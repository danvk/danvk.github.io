Youcan to this to all the menus that REALbasic is capable of making, like popup menus,contextual menus, etc. I was able to make a complete copy of the Hotline menu. SeeFigure 1.</P><P>&#160;&#160;The way you add icons or marks to a menu is kinda simple, The firstthing you do is to add internal resources to your project by dragging them in fromthe desktop. The resource must contain a &quot;CICN&quot; or &quot;ICON&quot; probertyor else your menu will look quite strange (See Figure 2). When<BR>you have a resource fork in your project, it's time to move on to the code.</P><P>&#160;&#160;First you create a MenuHandle. Then, you must find the menu you wishto play with. When you have a Menu Handle thet represent the menu you want to edit,you can use a simple syntax like <TT>SetItemIcon myMenu,1,411-256</TT>.</P><P>&#160;&#160;The commands are in the form: <TT>MethodName MenuHandle, NumberOfMenuItem,IconNumber</TT>. <IMG SRC="figure2.gif" WIDTH="214" HEIGHT="192" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0">Thesmart reader may notice that the IconNumber part is a little strange, it's IconID-256.So if the menu icon should be 241 the code would be 241-256. To be honest I am notquite sure why that is, but I think it has something to do with the way the Mac givesresources ID's.</P><P>&#160;&#160;MenuLib has quite a few features, but it's not a good choice for theRB beginner. When it comes to price, you should rember that you are paying for allof Einhugur's plugins and classes. Both the ones that are here now, and the onesthat will be avaliable later. To sum up: MenuLib does what it's suposed to do, nothingmore, nothing less.<BR><BR><B><I>- Review by Oliver Kofoed Pedesen</I></B></P><DIV ALIGN="RIGHT"><P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="49%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#99FF99"><B>&#160;Pros:</B> Provides many enhancements to RB's menu, and it can be used in<BR>			popupmenus and contextual menus also.<BR>			<B>&#160;Cons:</B> It's not for the RB beginner, and the docs do not provide a simple			How<BR>			To.
