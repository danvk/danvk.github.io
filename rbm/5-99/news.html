For more on this momentous occasion, check out our <A HREF="rb2.html">specialsection</A>. Also, 2.0.1 has already arrived, with a bunch of bug fixes.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">Foreign langauges of RB 2</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE></P><P>&#160;&#160;In the DR2 release notes, it seems that most releases have &quot;MoreInternationalization Strings Added&quot; in them. What does this mean? Eventually,version 2 will become available in seven languages: Dutch, English, French, Italian,Spanish, Japanese, and German. On another intersting note about versions of RB, itseems that RB will ship in retail in Australia!</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">API ACCESS!!</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE></P><P>&#160;&#160;Much to everyone's surprise, an otherwise humble looking set of releasenotes for 2.0.1a4 included a feature that many people have been asking for for ages:API access. If you've got 2.0.1a4, you can simply write (in any piece of code), &quot;DeclareSub &lt;whatever&gt; Lib &lt;fragment&gt; Alias &lt;method in fragment's name&gt;(parameters) as type&quot;, and &lt;whatever&gt; will become a valid statement. Whatdoes this mean? Essentially, RB became a heck of a lot more expandable in an instant.This was possible before (by using shared libs—see our January issue), but this issignificantly more convenient. Though I won't guarantee it, this will probably benext month's cover story.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">Ah-choo!

Check outour <A HREF="gestalt.html">Gestalt</A> article for more info on this useful new feature.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">Be gone Locals and Stack!</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE></P><P>&#160;&#160;Although they can be extremely useful, the Locals and Stack windows(the ones that pop up in the background whenever you run your program) are usuallyannoyances. Along with obscuring <B>all</B> of the major dekstop icons, these windowsare simply ugly. However, after complaining from many people going back to the DR1s,these windows are now optional. If you run a program, and close one of these windows,it will remain closed the next time you run a program.

It has a bizarre and less functional new interface for the MoviePlayer program,as well as support for a variety of other features. The main two that relate to RBare support for MP3s and Flash (yes, you can now play both in an RB project)</P><P>&#160;&#160;However, if you've got QT4, there as also some other functions youcan try. For example, the <TT>OpenURLMovie</TT> function takes an URL as a parameter,and returns a movie object–even a streaming movie.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Also, pictures now have an <TT>ImageCount</TT> property and an <TT>IndexedImage()</TT>property which will return frames of a GIF, pages of a multi-page TIFF, or even layersin a PhotoShop image. It doesn't always work, but it's definitely worth looking into.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">Sound Recording Arrives</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE></P><P>&#160;&#160;For a long time, RB has had horrible sound support, and this includesa total lack of sound recording capabilities. However, a new plugin has arrived thatgoes a long way to fixing this problem.</P><P>&#160;&#160;SoundLib 1.0, which can be obtained at <A HREF="http://home5.swipnet.se/~w-53123/hanland.html">http://home5.swipnet.se/~w-53123/hanland.html</A>is written by Jonaton Uppstr&#246;m and, among other things, it can record sounds.That's certainly not all that this can do though. Other features include the abilityto set/get the current system volume, and use PlainTalk to say a string.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">SuperSocketPro preview</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE></P><P>&#160;&#160;As a precursor to his much hyped plugin, SuperSocketPro, James Milne(<A HREF="http://www.essencesw.com">www.essencesw.com</A>) has released a portionof it for free. The AppleTalkBrowser plugin provides a new class that is part ofSuperSocketPro's AppleTalk Suite. It provides tools for gathering information aboutlocal networks, such as lists of zones, names of nodes in the zones, etc. SuperSocketPro itself has also gone beta, so be sure to check the Essence Software web siteif you're intersted in this exciting tool.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">Olin's Production Warehouses go berzerk!</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE></P><P>&#160;&#160;S&#248;ren Olin's PictureShader class has recently come out, and it'sspectacular. It takes in a picture, and returns a version of it shaded into any color.Yes, anyone could do this with a for loop and a graphics object, but PictureShaderis <B>fast</B>. In addition to that, it supports shading by using a mask, and colormask. Another similar, but open source product is PictureDisabler, which simply drawsa 50% transparent version of the picture.</P><P>&#160;&#160;And continuing his mad frenzy of releases, S&#248;ren has also releaseda class that will draw customized dashed lines based on a string. For example, &quot;1010&quot;would draw a dotted line. &quot;11110000&quot; would draw a dashed line, and so on.</P><P>&#160;&#160;And if <B>that</B> weren't enough, he also has released a tool thatallows more shapes to be drawn to a graphics object, such as an arc or an arrow.</P><P>All of S&#248;ren's work can be found at his <A HREF="http://www.olin.net/RB/">website</A>.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">Painting in a Canvas</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE></P><P>&#160;&#160;Dan Vanderkam, the author of httpSocket, has released a new classcalled CanvasPaint. This class allows a programmer to add painting capabilities toany of their programs by simply adding a canvas.
