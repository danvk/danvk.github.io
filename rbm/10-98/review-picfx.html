No,I'm not under some strange voodoo curse,  but this is becoming a pattern. Why? Becausethere's an incredibly large number of them!</P><P><IMG SRC="calculator.GIF" WIDTH="111" HEIGHT="202" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0">&#160;&#160;Thelatest in this set is Ian's Picture Effects, which provides methods to rotate pictures90&#176; in any direction, scale pictures easily (without using DrawPicture's 100sof parameters), duplicating pictures, brightening and darkening them, flipping them,cropping them, and tweaking their RGB components.</P><P>&#160;&#160; In my opinion, the most interesting function is the RGB Tweak one.As you can see from the screenshot to the right, it increases or decreases the amountof Red, Green, and Blue in a picture based on the parameters you pass it. This canbe useful, and can produce some interesting effects.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Another intersting function is the duplicate picture one. Usually,one would think that to duplicate a picture, you'd create a new picture variable,and use a statement like <TT>newpic=oldpic</TT>. This should duplicate it, right?Wrong! This only creates a pointer to it. So, any changes to oldpic are changed innewpic, and vice-versa. This can lead to a messy situation if a duplicate is whatyou really wanted. The duplicate picture method provides an easy and fast way tocreate a true duplicate of a picture.</P><P>&#160;&#160;This leads me to another function: scaling. Many people would saythat this function is pointless. After all, you can do the exact same thing withthe drawpicture method of the graphics object, right? Well, that <B>is</B> true,but the three parameters that this method takes are far less intimidating than the9 that DrawPicture takes.</P><P>&#160;&#160;So what's the final word? Picture Effects provides 10 very usefuleffects for pictures, and it's an open source module–always a good thing. There'sonly one problem. It's slow. VERY slow. However, this isn't neccesarily a problemwith the class. Functions like these are built-in to the Apple Toolbox, and are lightningfast (heck, some programs perform them in realtime). Since you can't access the toolboxfrom RB, we must live with slow yet useful modules like this. At least until pictureplugins come in (and they will).<BR clear = "right"><DIV ALIGN="RIGHT"><P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="49%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#99FF99"><B>&#160;Pros:</B> Provides a wide array of uesful graphics functions.
