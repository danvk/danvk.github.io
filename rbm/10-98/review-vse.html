As the first plugin that isn't free, it's a great deal: 50 new commandsfor $25. It provides methods to get and set many different pieces of information,such as the system volume, the system version, the mouse coordinates (local or global).It also includes other commands that perform actions, such as the Speak command,which uses Text to Speach to say a string in the default voice. And, possibly bestof all, it only takes up only 10K of space in your compiled programs.</P><P><IMG SRC="vseicons.gif" WIDTH="132" HEIGHT="230" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0">&#160;&#160;Thefirst thing I did when I got my copy of this product was to open up the reference.The reference has a list of all the commands at the left, and a document on the rightthat contains all the commands. It has examples and descriptions for all of them–amajor plus.</P><P>&#160;&#160;As I read through the reference, I couldn't help but think of howincredibly useful some of these routines would be for my programs. The ability toget the current volume and set it without resorting to AppleScript. Being able touse the mouse in SpriteSurfaces. I was genuinely excited.</P><P>&#160;&#160;For $25, this package will add new depth to your application. If ituses sound, you can add a volume control. If it uses sprites, you can add mouse support.If it uses toolbar buttons, you can add balloon help that pops up after the mousehasn't moved for a certain period of time.</P><P>&#160;&#160;However, I soon recovered from my initial jubilation and realizedsomething rather odd. Nearly all of the commands (about 40) retrieve or set systeminformation, and are very similiar to eachother (i.e., the FIVE commands that areused to get the state of the mouse).</P><P>&#160;&#160;Other commands are simply pointless, such as the &quot;Reverse&quot;command, which flips strings around (e.g. HELLO becomes OLLEH). I can't think ofa single case where you'd want to use this, and even then, there's no reason youcan't just write out a method on your own in RB.</P><P>&#160;&#160;What's the point of pointing this out? Simply put, the VSE pluginhas a bunch of junk in it. There are certainly uses for all the routines, but inmost cases, there's another way to do the exact same thing for absolutely free. Forexample, the speech commands, and volume commands can all be done through AppleScript.</P><P>&#160;&#160;That's not the only problem though. Judging by what most of the functionsdo, I figured that most of them couldn't be more than 2 or 3 lines long in C (thisis why the plugin uses so little space). I checked with someone who programs in C,and they confirmed this. This means that most of the commands that the VSE Utilityplugin includes would be extremely easy for Andrew to integrate into RB, and I seeno reason that this won't happen. Most of them should be built-in, such as the Speakcommand, and mouse commands.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Right now, this product is wonderful. Nearly all of the commands addnew and useful abilities to RB. However, if you buy this product now, there mightonly be 3 or 4 of its 50 commands that don't have equivalents that are built-in toRealbasic. And even if aren't added, a certain third party plugin maker has givenme reason to believe that he will make a similiar plugin for free in the near future...</P><DIV ALIGN="RIGHT"><P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="50%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#99FF99"><B>&#160;Pros:</B> Gives 50 new commands in one small plugin.
