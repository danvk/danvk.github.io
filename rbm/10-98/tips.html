When you're writing code, these windows are pointless. However,much to my dismay, many people simply never close these windows!</P><P>&#160;&#160;So, the tip is to keep these windows closed whenever you're <B>not</B>doing layout. You'll get a lot more screen space, and RB will run faster (the propertiespalette takes a long time to refresh).</P><P>&#160;&#160;To be even MORE super-effecient with your workspace, make a macrothat closes and opens all the toolbars with a single keystroke.<H2>Tip #2 - Beautify your code</H2><P>&#160;&#160;Many, many people give all their variables names that are entirelylowercase, such as &quot;sout, temp, i&quot;, and so on. Many more people don't leaveblank space in their code, and put comments at the end of lines without aligningthem. This is downright ugly!</P><P>&#160;&#160;So, when you're writing code, capitalize letters in variables thatare the start of words. For example, if the variable <TT>binval</TT> is a binaryvalue, name it <TT>BinVal</TT>. This just looks better.</P><P>&#160;&#160;And be sure to put in blank lines at points where the code is brokeninto sections. This makes it much clearer, and easier to read. Take these examples...</P><P><B>The bad</B></P><P><IMG SRC="badcode.gif" WIDTH="421" HEIGHT="247" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P><P>&#160;&#160;All the declarations are on a long line, and are all in lower case.There isn't any blank space, and the comments are randomly strewn about the line.</P><P><B>The good</B></P><P><IMG SRC="goodcode.gif" WIDTH="421" HEIGHT="247" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P><P>&#160;&#160;The variables are logically grouped, and have the correct case. Thereis blank space seperating the groups of code. The comments are lined up, and lookvery nice.This makes going back and editing it later much easier, and it makes iteasier for others to read as well.</BODY></HTML>
