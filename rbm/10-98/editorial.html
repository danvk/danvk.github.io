The program's goal was to do a list of operations over the internet. Theseincluded downloading, PPP Up, PPP Down, Wait Until &lt;time&gt;, and the likes.</P><P>&#160;&#160;In most other programming languages, this would have been a huge painto write. First of all, I'd have to write the batch program and interface itself,which would be fairly hard. Then, I'd have to write in HTTP and FTP transfer capabilities.In itself, each of these would have taken hours, if not days, and would have involvedreading long, boring documents in search of one piece of information.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Thank god for Realbasic! Thanks to RB's great class system, and themany available socket classes (in this case, httpSocket and RB FTP), I would havebeen able to write the entire program without knowing what a socket was! And eventhough I do know, I was still saved from countless hours of coding and debuggingthanks to classes.</P><P>&#160;&#160;This left me rather excited, and I began to realize that this wholescenario sounded familiar. Recognize it? Sure you do. It's OpenDoc!</P><P>&#160;&#160;Yes, Real Software has succeeded in places that Apple did not. Andthey didn't even try to!</P><P>&#160;&#160;Think about it. With OpenDoc, you took components, and put differentones into documents based on what you needed to get done. In RB, you take classesand plugins, and put them into different projects based on what you need.</P><P>&#160;&#160;In fact, classes in RB have an added benefit that OpenDoc components(sorry, Live Objects) didn't: they're usually open source. This allows people tointegrate them into their programs more tightly, and even take out parts they don'tneed.</P><P>&#160;&#160;If you take this whole concept to the extreme, when there are classesfor everything, making an application could become as simple as throwing a few classesinto a project, and putting together an interface. MUCH easier than writing the wholething from scratch!</P><P>&#160;&#160;As RB becomes more powerful, and more classes for more and more purposesbecome available, RB will become an even easier and faster language. By using otherpeople's classes in your program, you're basically getting a whole slew of developersfor whatever your project is. Heck, you could even release updates to your programwithout even writing a single new line of code.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Odd as this sounds, it's certainly true now, and will only becomemore so in the future.<BR><BR>- <A HREF="mailto:dantheox@aol.com">Dan Vanderkam</A> </MULTICOL></BODY></HTML>
