However, the same thing that happened to the Java compiler couldhappen to the windows compiler. In case you've forgotten it, the Java Compiler decreasedthe number of updates, because whenever a <IMG SRC="image33.gif" WIDTH="218" HEIGHT="142"ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="1" VSPACE="3">feature was added, it needed to be added threetimes—once in the IDE, once in the Mac compiler, and once in the Java Compiler.</P><P>&#160;&#160;On a related note, the buid application dialog has been changed onceagain (to the picture you see on the right). The Java compiler is back, so you canonce again put RB programs in your web pages. The same restrictions still apply though.You can't have modal dialogs, or quit. However, even though the Java checkbox isback, the &quot;Java compatibility&quot; check in the project settings window hasnot reappeard.</P><P>&#160;&#160;I'll probably have a test of this once-dead compiler setting nextissue, so be on the lookout!<BR clear = "right"></P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">REAL Software gets a color change</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;On October 13, REAL Software changed the colors of REALbasic from blueand black to green and black.(It went from <FONT COLOR="#0000DD"><B>REAL</B></FONT><FONTCOLOR="#000000"><B>basic</B> to </FONT><FONT COLOR="#006600"><B>REAL</B></FONT><FONTCOLOR="#000000"><B>basic</B>)</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&#160;&#160;Oddly enough, RB's colors have been green andblack for much longer than you might realize.

What does this mean? It means that yourcompiled programs will be smaller. Currently, the compiler throws everything intobuilt apps. So, if all your project uses is pushbuttons, it will still include codefor handling sockets, sprite surfaces, and noteplayers—even though they're completelysuperfluous.<BR>&#160;&#160;In the new compiler, which should appear soon, only neccesary code willbe put into built apps.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">James Milne's next plugins</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;After being pestered to oblivion, James Milne was coaxed into givingme a &quot;massive scoop&quot;, as he called it.

It nowinstalls PlayerPRO plugins into the extensions folder automatically, which meansthat you don't have to include them with your project. It also changes the namesof several properties for no apparent reason. This version of MadPlug was scheduledto arrive in July, but since then, James Milne has become smarter about release dates(see the previous news article).</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">RB Server updates</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;Much has happened for the Realbasic hotline servers this month. Here'sthe gist of it:</P><P>&#160;&#160;The Realbasic BBQ, a popular alternate RB server, has mysteriouslydissappeared. For about a week, anyone who tried to log in was given an &quot;InvalidLogin&quot; error. Nowadays, it''s just gone. The RB BBQ: Early August to Early September.RIP.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Also, the Realbasic caf&#233; (cafe.realbasic.com) has reformed theirhierarchy of accounts. For a brief period, people intersted in becoming administratorswere asked to send in an application. People who were accepted have been given junioradmin accounts (which, in reality, only have a few more abilities than no account).</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">Databases are coming!</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;One of the major selling points of RB Pro (which is what DR2 will eventuallybecome) is database support. This is something that is delivered in Visual Basicin the Professional and Enterprise versions, and it appears that Real SW is followinga similiar strategy.</P><P>&#160;&#160;We've got a feel for what this will be like with the Database object,which was introduced in DR2r7 and 8. There are several commands that return databaseobjects. These include commands that open DBase databases (OpenDTFDatabase), Oracle(OpenOracleDatabase), and OBDC (SelectOBDCDatabase).</P><P>&#160;&#160;For those who only need DBase support, and don't want to shell out$300 for the Pro version may wish to consider CTable (not CTable control, which hasbeen reviewed), a set of classes that opens DBase's .dbf files, and allows you toaccess them. CTable may be reviewed in a future issue.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">httpSocket updates</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;A large update to httpSocket has been released. This popular class addsallows you to use http easily and effectively using a public socket subclass. Thisversion is a total rewrite, and adds support for things such as referers, customclient names, Headers, relative URLs, password authentication and the works. Youcan get it at the RB Caf&#233; (under reusable classes), or from <A HREF="http://www.nd.edu/~jvanderk/rb/">www.nd.edu/~jvanderk/rb/</A></P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">Vector Graphics editing</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;As you probably know, vector graphics are graphics that are defined bytheir components (lines, circles, etc.), not their pixels (like a PICT is). Thisusually means that they're smaller, and it also means that everything is editable—evenafter you've drawn a hundred more shapes.<BR>&#160;&#160;These advantages come with a drawback though—writing a vector graphicseditor is <B>much</B> more difficult than a bitmap editor. However, thanks to MiniVector,a new reusable class, this is no longer a concern. MiniVector allows users to drawovals, lines, and rectangles directly on a canvas using any border size and fill,and allows them to edit or remove the shapes later. It even comes with it's own fileformat, and routines for drawing different sized versions of the image, in anti-aliasedor normal form.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">Bizzare DR2 additions</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;I can hardly wait for release notes to come bundled with new releasesof DR2, so that some of the truly bizarre features can be explained. On top of thelist this month: The &quot;New Class Interface&quot; command in the File menu, andthe AE Recorder in the Window menu.x</P><P>&#160;&#160;A class interface seems to be a cross between a method and a classwith some things of its own thrown in. You can only have methods in it, and it needsa super that is a class. However, it also has a property called &quot;Interfaces&quot;,which must contain the name of a class on the toolbar. I still haven't been ableto figure out what these do, but be on the lookout for more info in next issue!</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">HTML decoding</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;There's a new reusable class out that decodes HTML, and put's it intoa styled editfield. It is rather limited though. It can't support things that editfieldsdon't support (read: everything but text styles and sizes), so it's not incrediblyuseful. However, it does do a decent job of decoding very simple HTML. Then again,when I fed it a fairly tough HTML document (a bunch of images and a complex table),it spewed it out in 72-point Monaco. Oh well, I guess we'll just have to wait forJames Milne to come out with MozPlug.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">Noteplaying for dummies</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;Anyone who's ever used QBasic or GW-basic has undoubtedly used the PLAYcommand. This command let you type something like PLAY &quot;ABCDEFG#&quot;, andit would do it. It could also change the tempo, length of notes, and octave. It wasa wonderful way to do music, and I haven't found a replacement in any language thatwas nearly as good.<BR>&#160;&#160;You might argue that the noteplayer control is better. After all, itsupports 128 instruments (many more if you count the drumkit instrument), and itlets you set how softly or loudly the note is played. To that I respond, <B>BIG DEAL!</B>I've always thought that the NotePlayer was a horrible implementation of QuicktimeMusical Instruments. In order to play ONE NOTE, you had to create a button to playit, and a timer to stop it—more hassle than it was worth.<BR>&#160;&#160;NotePlayer Kit, which is a new set of classes, aims to fix this. Alongwith providing lists and popupmenu subclasses that list all 128 instruments by name,it provides a NotePlayer subclass that has a Play command that's almost identicalto QBasic's, and doesn't require any setup.
