They're fairly simple. The calculator'schip sends a binary number to a converter, which lights up the appropriate sectionsout of the seven used per digit (see picture to the left). These displays are cheap,and easy to make, which makes them perfect for low-cost calculators. The LCD Canvastries to imitate these displays, and does a very good job of it.<BR><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;This class is very simple. It has one main method (drawnumber),but it also allows you to control other aspects of it (such as the individual LEDsections). To try it, all you need to do is drag the class into your project, makea new LCD Canvas, and put something like <TT>me.DrawNumber 9</TT> in its opened event.Couldn't be simpler! However, if you try to draw a negative number, or a number largerthan 10, it simply clears itself. The only way to show large numbers is to use multipleLCD Canvases, and the only way to show a negative sign is to manually set the middleLCD. These are the only major drawbacks of this class.<BR><BR><IMG SRC="image.gif" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="144" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0">&#160;&#160;&#160;LCDCanvas also lets you select colors for the LCDs and background. You can either dothis manually, or by using the &quot;UseBuiltInScheme&quot; method. There are fourbuilt-in schemes, one of which is sure to satisfy you.<BR><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;Topping the cool-but-useless list for this control is the Animatefeature. Yes, by using one method, you can tell the canvas to animate itself. Youcan even tell it which direction to animate it in! This looks pretty cool, but ifit has any practical use, I sure can't think of it!<BR><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;LCD Canvas is a very simple control that accomplishes its purposewell. It's quick, looks good, and has more than enough features. However, lackingthe ability to show multi-digit and negative numbers through the DrawNumber methodis a major drawback.</P><DIV ALIGN="RIGHT"><P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="49%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#99FF99"><B>&#160;Pros:</B> Simple way to show LCD-style numbers.
