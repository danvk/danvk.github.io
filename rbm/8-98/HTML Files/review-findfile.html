After you install it into the plugins folder, a new control appears in thetoolbar–a find file control. You can tell this method to find a file, but you canonly search by &quot;name contains ___&quot;, a major drawback. To test its accuracy,I searched for &quot;realbasic&quot; on my hard drive. Here were the results:<B></B></P><P><B>Results</B> for &quot;realbasic&quot; in example:<BR><B>Items Found</B>: 56<BR><B>Items that existed:</B> 2<BR><B>Number of duplicates:</B> 11</P><P>&#160;&#160;As you may have guessed, I was shocked! You can expect not to findany duplicates, and <B>certainly</B> not any non-existing folders. Worst of all,the two items that didn't exist were duplicates! </P><P>&#160;&#160;James Milne claims that his plugin is faster than the Find File app,and I most certainly agree. However, it's not THAT much faster, and considering thatthe find file program can search by 12 different criterion, and can even search bya file's <B>contents</B>, I'm not surprised. And, to top all this off, it doesn'teven have a Read Me file!</P><P>&#160;&#160;RB Find File makes finding files easy and fast, but that's about allyou can say about it that's good. It's output is pathetic–it returns duplicates andnon-existent folders! RB Find File is a plugin to be avoided until James Milne makesit work properly.<BR></P><DIV ALIGN="RIGHT"><P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="49%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#99FF99"><B>&#160;Pros:</B> Makes searching for files quick and easy.<BR>			<B>&#160;Cons:</B> Outputs large numbers of duplicates and non-existing files (i.e.			they end in &quot;::&quot;).
