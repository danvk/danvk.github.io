As it was, I was doing all the work (except the Julycover; thanks Chris!), and no one was volunteering to do any writing. So, I madea bold move! I said that this magazine was stopped until more people volunteered.I probably should have recruited people before the first issue came out, but oh well.<BR><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;This turned out to be a smart move! I received e-mails from sixdifferent people saying that they would be willing to write. Apparently people won'twork unless I make it that or no RB Monthly. Oh well...<BR><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;Now that more people are writing, I can have more reviews and columnsthat represent more skill levels. For example, Christian Burnell's column is gearedmore towards power users, whereas Mike's column is geared towards beginners. Theirnew columns should probably debut next month.<BR><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;I also changed the layout somewhat. You may have noticed that thetop frame is now split in two. I personally think that this looks better, and makesthings simpler. I also changed from using background patterns to solid colors. Ithink that this is much clearer, and looks better. Also, it makes blending graphicsinto the background possible.<BR><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;Things certainly have changed this month, so there's bound to besome fine-tuning. I'd certainly appreciate any feedback, so be sure to write dantheox@aol.com!<BR><BR>- Dan Vanderkam</BODY></HTML>
