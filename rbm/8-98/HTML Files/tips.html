He also pointed out that by using the strcomp function, you could speed theseup several hundred times. Here's how it works…<BR><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="100%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="50%">First of all, you need to learn what the StrComp function does. As its name implies,			it compares two strings. The value it returns tells you if the two strings are the			same, or if they're not, it tells you which one comes before the other in alphabetical			order. The handy table to the right may simplify things some.</TD>		<TD WIDTH="2%"><HR WIDTH="1" SIZE="100" NOSHADE>		</TD>		<TD WIDTH="48%">			<TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="100%">				<TR>					<TD WIDTH="13%"><B>s1</B></TD>					<TD WIDTH="14%"><B>s2</B></TD>					<TD WIDTH="73%"><B>StrComp(s1, s2, 0)</B></TD>				</TR>				<TR>					<TD WIDTH="13%">a</TD>					<TD WIDTH="14%">z</TD>					<TD WIDTH="73%">&#160;&#160;-1</TD>				</TR>				<TR>					<TD WIDTH="13%">z</TD>					<TD WIDTH="14%">a</TD>					<TD WIDTH="73%">&#160;&#160;+1</TD>				</TR>				<TR>					<TD WIDTH="13%">A</TD>					<TD WIDTH="14%">a</TD>					<TD WIDTH="73%">&#160;&#160;-1</TD>				</TR>				<TR>					<TD WIDTH="13%">A</TD>					<TD WIDTH="14%">A</TD>					<TD WIDTH="73%">&#160;&#160;0</TD>				</TR>			</TABLE>		</TD>	</TR></TABLE><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><BR></FONT>&#160;As you can see from the helpful table, if the two stringsare the same,it returns 0. So, the statement<BR><TT>If s1=s2 then</TT><BR>&#160;&#160;is the same as<BR><TT>If StrComp(s1, s2, 0)=0 then</TT><BR><BR>&#160;&#160;The strComp example may look longer and more complicated, but in reality,it's a LOT faster.<BR><BR>&#160;&#160;If you don't want to get stuck typing StrComp for the rest of your life,there IS a better solution. Just create a new method called &quot;Equal&quot; thattakes two strings as a parameter, and returns a boolean. Here's the code for it:<BR><BR><TT>Function Equal(s1 as string, s2 as string) as boolean<BR>if strcomp(s1, s2, 0)=0 then<BR>return true<BR>else<BR>return false<BR>end if<BR>End Function</TT><BR><BR>&#160;&#160;After you type in that function, you can use the format &quot;If Equal(s1,s2) then&quot;, which makes much more sense, and looks nicer. If you want to testto see if two strings AREN'T equal, just replace that statement with &quot;If NotEqual(s1, s2) then&quot;.<BR><BR>Speeding up your program couldn't be easier!<BR><BR><BR><B>Tip #2&#160;—&#160;Declare items the quick way</B></P><P>&#160;&#160;In case you didn't already realize it, declaring variables used tobe a nightmare. First of all, you had to put them all on different lines, and theyall had to have an &quot;as type&quot; clause after them. This made for some icky,and <B>very</B> long code.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Things eventually got better though. You can now declare multiplevariables on one line. However, there's still oen more trick that not many peopleknow about...<BR><BR>&#160;If you want to declare two or more variables of the same type, you can omitthe &quot;as type&quot; part. For example, <TT> dim s as string, t as string</TT>&#160;couldbe rewritten as <TT>dim s, t as string</TT>. This is a very useful shortcut, especiallywhen there are many variables of the same type.</P><P>&#160;So, if you still aren't convinced, look at these three snapshots:</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="100%">	<TR>		<TD><B>Really old</B></TD>		<TD><TT>Dim m as folderitem<BR>			Dim n as folderitem<BR>			Dim o as folderitem<BR>			Dim p as folderitem</TT></TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD><B>Current</B></TD>		<TD><TT>Dim m as folderitem, n as folderitem<BR>			Dim o as folderitem, p as folderitem</TT></TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD><B>The Secret Way&#160;</B></TD>		<TD><TT>Dim m, n, o, p as folderitem</TT></TD>	</TR></TABLE></P><P>&#160;&#160;As you can see from that lovely diagram, it's the biggest clarityimproving declaration change you can make. It also saves a bunch of typing, and youwon't have to scroll to see everything. So, be sure to use this trick whenever youcan!!!</P><P><B>Tip #3&#160;—&#160;Flicker-free editfields</B></P><P>&#160;&#160;If you've ever made a program where text is constantly being addedto a text field (like in a chat program), you'll know just how much Edit fields flicker.You may have thought it was unavoidable, but there is a trick!<BR>&#160;&#160;Normally, to append something to an edit field, you'd use something likethis:</P><P>&#160;<TT>TxtChat.Text = TxtChat.Text + &quot;Dan Vanderkam:  RB Monthly rules!&quot;</TT><BR><BR>&#160;&#160;However, this would make the edit field flicker, especially if therewas more info above what was being added. There is a trick though. This is the codefor it:</P><P>&#160;<TT>TxtChat.SelStart = Len(TxtChat.Text)<BR>&#160;TxtChat.SelText = &quot;Dan Vanderkam:  RB Monthly rules!&quot;</TT></P><P>&#160;&#160;This method, believe it or not, guarantees that almost NO flickeringtakes place. And, as an added bonus, it scrolls down to the end of the text. Here'swhat it does:</P><P>&#160;&#160;1) The first line moves the insertion point to the end (which is givenby the len function).<BR>&#160;&#160;2) The second line adds the text at the insertion point.</P><P>&#160;&#160;So, it's two easy steps to flicker-free text. (Hey! That rhymes!)</P><P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<FONTSIZE="2">Thanks to Ian L. for this one!</FONT></BODY></HTML>
