It costs $99.95, or $59.95 if you're under 18. You can also get the 600-page,printed documentation for just under $40, and a CD full of RB stuff for $10. Thispricing system makes it the cheapest programming language you can get for the mac—CodeWarrioris $400!<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#0099FF">RB gets praise from the press</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;Following its Macworld New York debut, Realbasic received ravereviews all over the place! It's the only powerful rapid-development program forthe mac (in other languages, you create controls by using commands, not by drawingthem), which makes it extremely useful. As Andy Inahtko commented, this makes iteasy to concentrate on design, and not so much on the actual programming. Also, MacAddicthas made RB the official programming language on their CD. What this means, I'm notexactly sure...<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#0099FF">Anti-Aliasing for RB</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;A new thread this month allows RB programs to anti-alias pictures.Though it is extremely slow (about 12 seconds for a 50x50 8-bit picture on a 200Mhz603e!), it is also very good. Also, it is a thread, which allows it to run in thebackground. You can get this thread from the Realbasic caf&#233;.<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;Curious about this, I made my own, which is <B>much</B> faster.It also gives you the option of either blurring or smoothing the graphic. It toois available at the Realbasic caf&#233;.<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#0099FF">Eject that disk, and stuff it!</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;James Milne has written several small plugins this month that dovarious things. One, EjectDisk, adds one method to RB: Eject(vol as folderitem).This ejects the folderitem (if its possible). The other, StuffPlug, does as its nameimplies–it uses StuffIt. It adds Stuff and UnStuff methods, which allow you to useStuffIt in conjunction with your RB programs.<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#0099FF">First versions of DR2 released</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;As was promised, the first versions of DR2 have been released soonafter RB went commercial. Though the first three revisions of DR2 aren't officialand don't have release notes, they do exist. If you look for new features in thereference, then you're out of luck. They're not there. Instead, just look at <A HREF="DR2rn.html">thisfile</A> for all the release notes.<BR><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#0099FF">Serial and Sockets revamped</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="100%">	<TR>		<TD ROWSPAN="6">&#160;&#160;&#160;In the first two revisions of DR2, there were properties added			to the socket and serial controls. As you can see from the nifty chart to the right,			the <TT>PPPStatus (integer)</TT> property of a socket allows you to get all the PPP			info that you need. Socket controls also have PPPConnect and PPPDisconnect methods			now.<BR>			&#160;&#160;&#160;Sockets weren't the only communications control that got an improvement			though. A new SerialPort class was added, which allows you to get the name of the			port, its input and output drivers, as well as its rated and maximum speeds.<BR>			&#160;&#160;&#160;There are two ways you can get a serial port class. Serial controls			now have a <TT>.SerialPort</TT> property, which gives you access to their ports.			Also, the new system object has two properties: SerialPortCount, and an array of			all the serial ports.</TD>		<TD ROWSPAN="6"><HR WIDTH="1" SIZE="150" NOSHADE>		</TD>		<TD WIDTH="59" HEIGHT="16"><B>Value</B></TD>		<TD WIDTH="81" HEIGHT="16"><B>PPP Status</B></TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="59" HEIGHT="13">0</TD>		<TD WIDTH="81" HEIGHT="13">not installed</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="59" HEIGHT="13">1</TD>		<TD WIDTH="81" HEIGHT="13">Disconnected</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="59" HEIGHT="13">2</TD>		<TD WIDTH="81" HEIGHT="13">Connecting</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="59" HEIGHT="13">3</TD>		<TD WIDTH="81" HEIGHT="13">Connected</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="59" VALIGN="TOP">4</TD>		<TD WIDTH="81" VALIGN="TOP">Disconnecting</TD>	</TR></TABLE></P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#440000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#0099FF">Version Jumps</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#0066FF"><BR></FONT>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Here are all of July's updates to RB.
