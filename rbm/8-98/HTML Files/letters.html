This is a great layout you have here. It is simple and easyto navigate, but amazingly informative and useful. I am really interested in workingwith RB. I got the evaluation copy and am practicing and learning. Once I get<BR>more into RB I would probably love to help out your sight in any way possible. <BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;- Michael &quot;Growl&quot; Sunderbruch</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000077">&#160;&#160;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">Ooh goody! Feedback!Thanks!</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000077">Hello after reading RB mounthly I felt I had to pointout a few things:<BR><BR>1. The link to our class is wrong, it links to the CStrTableArray, but not the<BR>   table control. the CStrTableArray has no interface like the control you reviewed.<BR><BR>2. Its wrong in your arcticle that you have to use SetCell if you only have one column.The   <BR>   first column text is set via AppendRow or InsertRow.<BR><BR>3. Einhugur is spelled Einhugur.<BR><BR>4. Its was not a mistake the way the column headers are not connected to the sort.Only very few spreadsheets sort when you click the colum headers. They are undefinedbuttons because only very few users wanted them to sort, many users wanted to makethem do something else. The sample where they are used to sort, only demonstatesone way of using them.<BR><BR>5. Its CTableControl, not CTable (its confusing because there is another class thatuses the CTable name) (support class)<BR><BR>Best regards....<BR><BR>Bj&#246;rn Eir&#237;ksson<BR><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">Now that I look back at it, I <B>did</B>review CTable as more of a list control than a table control. As for the link, sorry.It's just that your website is rather confusing (after all, it's made in CyberStudio).Sorry about the name...</FONT></BODY></HTML>
