I don't get a sense of completenesswith the manuals supplied with Realbasic, and will probably just hack through untilthe trial period is over and give up. No decent manuals make it VERY tough to learnthis stuff. Back to original thought. How about a beginners section helping us lowlybegineers learn this stuf? –&#160;D<FONT SIZE="1">AVID</FONT> J<FONT SIZE="1">ANIK</FONT>-J<FONTSIZE="1">ONES</FONT><FONT COLOR="#330066"></FONT></P><P><B>&#160;&#160;Thanks! I don't know if I'll add a beginners section, but thereare tons of tutorials around the internet.

Your newsletter has been very useful.<BR>&#160;&#160;Maybe I've misunderstood your points but I disagree with your complaintsabout multiple versions of RB, what with the release version and DR2 bleeding edgeversion. I think it's highly desirable to have a stable release version and a separateone in development. If I'm writing an application I don't want to be simultaneouslydebugging an RB beta. – G<FONT SIZE="1">OWAN</FONT><FONT COLOR="#660066"></FONT></P><P><B>&#160;After experiencing constant crashes whenever I RAN A PROGRAM in DR2,I have a new appreciation for the stabler versions. However, I still think that chaosisn't the way to go for version numbers. (yes, chaos is the right word. F9 can'topen projects that have been saved in DR2)</B></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P>&#160;&#160;It is good to see such interest in REALBasic. I think that this productis going to catch fire and be the top choice in rapid application development. Whenit does, this eMag will be our viewport into classes and techniques available.
