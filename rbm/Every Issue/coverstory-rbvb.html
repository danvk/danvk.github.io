You can now drag VB's forms into the project window. It will import themas accurately as it can (which is fairly good), and will even put the code in itsproper places.</P><P>&#160;&#160;The surprising part is the compatibility in code. For the most part,Visual Basic and REALbasic have very similiar languages. In fact, the only ways thereare major differences are in file I/O, graphics, and expandability.</P><P>&#160;&#160;So if each language is so similiar, which one is better? That's thequestion I've set out to answer in this section. I've made up my mind, and this articleshould help you make up yours.</P><H2>Round 1: Control Layout</H2><H3>Visual Basic</H3><P>&#160;&#160;In both languages, laying out the controls on a window is an essentialpart of making a program. Both have similiar ways of doing this. In Visual Basic,you select items from a floating tools palette that is nearly identical to RB's.After you've selected a tool, you can draw on the form using it. After drawing acontrol, the tool always reverts back to an arrow, which you can use to modify andselect controls. It's always quick and responsive, unless you make unreasonable forms(i.e., they have 100 picture controls on them).</P><P>&#160;&#160;The properties window is wonderful. The top half contains a text fieldwith a button next to it. The bottom half has a list of properties and their values듮extonly, not checkboxes or popupmenus. When you select a property, it appears at thetop, where you can edit it. If you double-click a boolean property, it toggles. Ifyou double-click another property with preset values, it cycles through them. Theproperties window is always responsive, and looks very good.</P><H3>REALbasic</H3><P>&#160;&#160;In RB, you drag-and-drop controls from a palette onto a window. Thecontrols are then created at a default size, and selected. When you move or resizea control, it's edges will snap-to the edges of other objects듯nless you have theCommand key down. However, it is often very slow, especially when there are manyobjects on it, and the properties window is open on older computers. For example,on my 33Mhz '040, it's impossible to double-click items to open the code editor.The time it takes to refresh the properties window is longer than the double-clickspeed.</P><P>&#160;&#160;However, when the properties window <B>is</B> working, it's wonderful.Booleans are actual checkboxes, and values with preset types appear in popupmenusright next to the name of the property. Also, text appears in it's actual style.</P><H3>The Winner?</H3><P>&#160;&#160;It depends. If you have a slow computer, VB is the definite winner.VB's design system runs faster on my 33Mhz 486 than RB's does on my 200Mhz 603e.If you have a fast computer though, it's a draw. The properties window in RB is moreconvenient, but is also less attractive. VB's isn't quite as effective, but it isn'tslow and ugly.</P><P><HR NOSHADE></P><H2>Round 2: The Code Editor</H2><H3>Visual Basic</H3><P>&#160;&#160;In Visual Basic, the code editor is simple, completely graphics-free,and very powerful. All the controls appear in a popupmenu on the left. All the eventsappear in a popupmenu at the right. Creating shared and global objects and data typesis a breeze. Simply type them in under (general), (declarations). You can also typein constants, and data types듭omething that's much more convenient than choosingitems from a menu. The editor lets you colors keywords in a custom color, checkssyntax, and makes your code clearer whenever you change lines. Though it may seemlike doing this as you type is better, I actually prefer VB's way of doing this.Having words change color and indent themselves as you type is distracting.</P><H3>REALbasic</H3><P>&#160;&#160;RB's code editor is very graphical. There's a hierarchial list onthe left with icons and folders. To add a method or variable, you have to choosea menu command드 huge waste of time. In addition, if you type in &quot;Sub Hello()&quot;,or something like that, it won't make a new subroutine들t'll just give you errors.Also, to make a new data type, you have to make an entirely new class드 waste oftime if all it is is a two-variable coordinate class.</P><H3>The Winner?</H3><P>&#160;&#160;I'll have to go with VB on this one. Being able to do everything fromthe keyboard and in the code editor is wonderful. It also lets you indent howeveryou want, which is something I personally like. It also works better than RB's. Forexample, you can copy declarations of functions as well as their code드 major helpwhen transfering something from a form to a class. Finally, as an added bonus, it'llbeautify your code for you (i.e. <TT>msgbox &quot;Hello there&quot; &quot;No. </TT>becomes<FONT COLOR="#0000DD"><TT>MsgBox</TT></FONT><TT> &quot;Hello There&quot; + &quot;No.&quot;</TT>)Of course, this behavior is purely optional, so code-control freaks don't have toget upset over this.</P><P><HR NOSHADE></P><H2>Graphics</H2><H3>Visual Basic</H3><P>&#160;&#160;In Visual Basic, using graphics is accomplished by placing a Pictureor Image control on a form. You then choose a picture file to put on this picture.When the program is running, You can save and load pictures through code, and drawa picture onto another picture using a mask in a variety of ways by using the WindowsAPI's BitBlt function. Also, you can use the PatBlt function to display patterns.The Picture control has methods such as Line and PSet, which draw lines, and setpixels.</P><H3>REALbasic</H3><P>&#160;&#160;In RB, graphics work is done through, appropriately enough, the graphicsobject. Pictures can be put in a project without appearing on a form, and there area wide variety of methods for editing graphics, such as DrawLine, DrawRect, DrawPolygon,DrawString, etc. For added speed, RGBSurfaces can be used. Pictures can be drawnonto other pictures using the DrawPicture method of a graphics object, but thereis no support for masks or patterns.</P><H3>The Winner?</H3><P>&#160;&#160;This round is most definitely a win for REALbasic. Having to use theWindows API whenever drawing a picture is incredibly tedious, and making things likecanvas subclasses is extremely difficult, as windows has no equivalent to the Refreshevent.</P><P><HR NOSHADE></P><H2>Expandability</H2><H3>Visual Basic</H3><P>&#160;&#160;In Visual Basic, </P><H3>REALbasic</H3><P>&#160;&#160;In RB, </P><H3>The Winner?</H3><P>&#160;&#160;This round goes to</BODY></HTML>
