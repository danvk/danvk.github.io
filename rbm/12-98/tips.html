Darned useful, and I hope you like it!</P><P>&#160;&#160;<FONT SIZE="4"><B>Tip #1—Use Control Binding</B></FONT></P><P>&#160;&#160;One of the coolest new features of the DR2 releases has been controlbinding. This feature, which is available in DR2r24 and up, has been simplifyingmy life quite a bit, and it should simplify your's too!</P><P>&#160;&#160;The idea behind control binding is that in many programs, clickingon a button, or selecting an item in a list affects the appearance of another control.For example, clicking the a button might start playing a movie, and clicking stopmight (logically enough), stop it.</P><P><IMG SRC="moviewin1.gif" WIDTH="135" HEIGHT="181" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0">&#160;&#160;Normally,this would involve writing some code—a whopping one line for each button. However,as lazy developers, this is simply too much! Control binding aims to simplify thisoh-so-complex process.</P><P>&#160;&#160;First off, we'll need to create three controls: One MoviePlayer, andtwo PushButtons, so that your project looks something like the picture to the left.</P><P>&#160;&#160;This setup is fairly simple. If you've had any experience with themovieplayer control, then you probably know how you could implement this. Open thecode editor, and put <TT>MoviePlayer1.Start</TT> in the Start button's Action event,and <TT>MoviePlayer1.Stop</TT> in the Stop button's Action event. However, I havea far more interesting way of doing this: one that doesn't even involve opening thecode editor!</P><P>&#160;&#160;First off, select the Start button. Next, hold down the Command andShift keys, and drag it onto the MoviePlayer control. A line will appear, and themovieplayer will be hilighted with a blue border. Let go of the mouse button. Thisdialog will (hopefully) appear:</P><P><IMG SRC="image23.gif" WIDTH="413" HEIGHT="234" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P><P><IMG SRC="image24.gif" WIDTH="135" HEIGHT="181" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0">&#160;&#160;Sincewe want the first button to play the movie, select the first option in the list.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Next, do the exact same things for the stop button, except make it<B>stop</B> the movie. When you choose OK, your window should like like the pictureto the right. If you drag a movie into the project, and set the movieplayer's Movieproperty (in the properties window) to that movie, then you've got a complete project.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Simple, huh? And you didn't need to type a single line of code!</P><P>&#160;&#160;Personally, I think this is an extremely exciting addition. As moreand more bindings are made possible, this feature will become more and more useful.Not only will it make life easier for beginners (at that point, the less code, thebetter), but it'll make life much simpler for everyone. Now if there were only away to delete a binding...<BR clear = "right"></P><P>&#160;&#160;<FONT SIZE="4"><B>Tip #2—Use Constants</B></FONT></P><P>&#160;&#160;A great new feature that many people have been asking for has finallyarrived: Constants. Constants are normally variables with a preset value. For example,in Visual Basic, you'd define a constant by typing in <TT>Global Const PI=3.14159</TT>.This would add a variable called PI that could be accessed from anywhere.</P><P>&#160;&#160;RB's version of this feature is more complicated, but much more powerful.In this example, I'll show you how to use it to set the value of PI based on thetype of computer that the program is being run on. For Macs and Java machines, PIwill be 3.14159 (the right number). For Windows, the value will be 3.14112. (Muchthanks to the mailing list for this devious idea!)</P><P>&#160;&#160;First of all, we'll want to make a module. Constants can only existin modules, even though there's a &quot;constants&quot; section in classes too.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Open up the module, and choose &quot;New Constant...&quot; from theEdit menu. You should see a screen that looks something like this:</P><P><IMG SRC="constantwin1.gif" WIDTH="453" HEIGHT="324" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P><P>&#160;&#160;As you can see, it's <B>much</B> more complicated than simply typinga value for a variable!</P><P>&#160;&#160;First of all, type in &quot;PI&quot; in the name field. In the valuefield, type 3.14159. You must give constants a value, or RB won't recognize them.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Now comes the fun part! Click the &quot;Add...&quot; button in thelower left corner. The following dialog will appear:</P><P><IMG SRC="addconstwin.gif" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="174" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P><P>&#160;&#160;From the platform menu, select &quot;Macintosh&quot;. Then, type in3.14159 in the Value field. Finally, click OK to add the type. You'll want to dothis for Java too.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Finally, add another constant, and select Windows from the platformmenu. In the Value field, type 3.14112. Click OK. Your Constants window should looklike this:</P><P><IMG SRC="constantwin2.gif" WIDTH="453" HEIGHT="324" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P><P>&#160;&#160;After you click OK, your constant has been added. From now on, youcan use it like a normal variable with the name PI throughout your code. However,there's also a special way to use constants. On a PushButton, make the caption anumber sign (#) followed by the constant's name. The button caption will automaticallybecome whatever value that constant is!</BODY></HTML>
