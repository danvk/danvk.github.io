These controls are (from left to right, and top to bottom) a placard,a popup menu triangle, an image well, a seperator line, chasing arrows, a spin button,a disclosure triangle, and a bevel button/menu.</P><P>&#160;&#160;These controls certainly aren't shocking additions, and all but oneof them (the bevel button/menu) had already been created as a reusable class. However,having these as simple controls makes life a great deal easier. Instead of havingto use canvases, which appeared as blanks in the IDE, we can now see our buttonswithout running the program! Hooray!<BR><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">#Pragma, we welcome thee</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;Another shocking addition in DR2 (well, not that shocking) was the <TT>#pragma</TT>command. Technically speaking, it's not a command, but a compiler directive. Thismeans that when the RB compiler runs into a #pragma statement, it adjusts itselfaccording to what the statement says. So far, there are two uses for this.</P><P>&#160;&#160;First of all, there's the <TT>#pragma disableBackgroundTasks</TT>directive, which does what it implies–it disables background tasks. This stops RBfrom updating controls while a routine is running. For example, it won't update progressbars, even if you set them. Why would you want it to do this? Simple: it gives youa big speed boost.</P><P>&#160; The other directive is <TT>#pragma disableBoundsChecking</TT>, which alsodoes what its name implies. Normally, whenever RB runs into an array, it must checkto see if the item specified is within the array's bounds. If it's not, then youget an OutOfBounds error. This directive disables that, and thus speeds up methodsthat deals with arrays.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">Databasese take off</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE>&#160; Back in the not-so-distant days of DR1, database support was going to be oneof the new features in &quot;REALbasic Pro&quot;. Well, that day is now.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Using the DR2's new Database object, you can now open (and access)databases in close to 10 different formats, ranging from comma delimited text to4D web servers. Not only can you access all of these database formats, you can alsoread from them all using the exact same classes and methods. Now <B>that's</B> databasesupport!</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">Geoff chats...and we listen!</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE>&#160;&#160;On November 18, from 7:00-9:00 PM Eastern standard time, Geoff Perlmanand Jason Parsely (two people from REAL Software) were answering people's questionsabout RB at the MacResource Hotline Server. As usual, the admins asked stupid questions,such as &quot;when will we be able to edit text on a cell-by-cell basis?&quot;. Youalready can people! Anyway, here are the major things that we found out:</P><OL>	<LI>Geoff wears briefs! (Yes, someone asked this)	<LI>We learned what class interfaces do! (See the Tips section of this issue for	more)	<LI>The RB application itself won't be ported to windows, as that would put REAL	Software in direct competition with Microsoft—never a good idea.	<LI>The folks at Real SW will be hiring more engineers to help Andrew improve RB.	<LI>A technical support phone number may be created soon, though free e-mail support	will still exist.	<LI>Real SW is talking to Apple about a bundling deal.</OL><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">Constants.</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;Yes, it's one of the blander news titles I've had, but they're certainlyimportant! This new feature, which was added in DR2r25, allows you to define constants,which are basically variables with a preset, never-changing value. There's more onthis in the <A HREF="tips.html">tips</A> section.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">New Sprite Engine and List Box</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE>&#160;&#160;The SpriteSurface and Listbox controls have received major revisionsin recent DR2 releases. Beginning with r21, the listbox is totally redone. Thoughyou can't see any changes, the difference is there. There aren't any major new featureswith this list box though, and there <B>still</B> isn't a triangle button in thetop right corner that lets you reverse sort order. However, there is one <A HREF="quicktips.html#6">usefuladdition</A>...</P><P>&#160;&#160;Also, the SpriteSurface now allows tiles and scrolling of tiles. Inthe future, this will be a good way to make an interactive background, but as ofnow, it's just slow.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">Documentation is on the way!</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;One of the major annoyances in DR2 has been the lack of any instructions(or even entries in the reference) on how to use all the new features. However, asthe 1.0 line is nearing its end, the folks at REAL SW have informed me that theywill indeed be updating the reference for DR2 in the near future. This update willprobably arrive sometime in December, so be on the lookout!</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">More picture formats!</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;Realbasic, as of DR2r23, can now open all the image types supported byQuickTime. For the record, these are PICT, JPEG, GIF, TIFF, QuickTime Image (QIF),PhotoShop (PSD) and Windows BMP. And, to top that off, you can now save images asJPEGs using the new SaveAsJPEG method of folderitems. You can't set the level ofcompression however.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">Einhugur controls arrive!</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR><IMG SRC="image31.gif" WIDTH="55" HEIGHT="47" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0">&#160;&#160;BjornEinhugur, who has written many, many plugins that give you access to ToolBox callsfrom within RB, has venture into new grounds: plugin controls.</P><P>&#160;&#160;So far, he has written three new control plugins: TableControlPlug,WindowSplitter, and Shapes. The <IMG SRC="tablecontrolplug.gif" WIDTH="253" HEIGHT="101"ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0">TableControl plugin is a version of his popular CTableControlclass (which was reviewed in our second issue) with several new features rolled in.The Shapes plugin is the same as the built-in RB shapes, except that they can containpatterns, and have MouseUp and MouseDown events.</P><P>&#160;&#160;These controls are available to everyone who has registered one ofBjorn's other plugins.<BR clear = "right"></P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">Navigation Services, for better or worse.</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;Geoff promised that Realbasic would have support for Navigation Services(the new file dialogs in Mac OS 8.5) before 8.5 actually came out. Though this turnedout to be flat-out wrong, RB did get Nav Services support this month—25 days <B>after</B>8.5 came out.<BR>&#160;&#160;This sounds great, but quite frankly, it's horrible. If you use a filedialog (while a program is running, or just to open a project), the next thing youdo—whether it's running the program, opening a file, or opening a code editor—alwayscrashes the computer with a type 10 error. And if this weren't bad enough, your filetypes don't work with it! It just never displays ANY files. I find it surprisingthat this version was even <B>released</B> with bugs this big.<BR>&#160;&#160;However, as one of the two people in the world who actually prefers theold dialogs, I didn't feel any grief when I disabled Nav Services.
