Then, during the next month, I was unable to work on RBMfor about two weeks, and spent some time trying to get other people to write forthe magazine. This ended up making issue 3 come out a bit over a week late.</P><P>&#160;&#160;After that, issues four and five ended up coming out a few days lateeach, which pushed the date for new issues to the 18th.</P><P>&#160;&#160;At this point, I realized that I should take a break for the nexttwelve days, and restructure the magazine. Then, I could start coming out with newissues on December 1.</P><P>&#160;&#160;So, that's why this issue was late: I simply wanted to get the releasedates back on track again.</P><P>&#160;&#160;And now, for the usual, &quot;what's on my mind this month&quot;...</P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P>&#160;&#160;The new DR2 releases of RB are great! As anyone who used Realbasicduring its DR1 period knows, the simple thrill of getting great new features oncea week is wonderful. As RB approached 1.0, we saw a period of increasing stablility,but very few new features. As much as I want improved stability (RB crashes on meabout once every 10 minutes), I have to admit, this was boring!</P><P>&#160;&#160;However, the DR2 releases have one neat feature that the DR1 releasesdidn't: an aura of mystery.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Have I gone psyho to think this? Not really. Downloading a new versionof RB w/o knowing what you'll be getting is quite exciting—especially since you'llfind out in a day or two.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Also, the new features that are being added in the DR2s are also great—databaseaccess, QuickTime (which the cover story is on this month), more controls, navigationservices, constants—the list goes on and on.</P><P>&#160;&#160;When RB version 2.0 is released (or RB Pro, whichever DR2 becomes),it'll be one heck of an app. I'll certainly miss the mystery when it comes with releasentoes and a reference, but hey, practicality will ultimately win out. And if I getbored of that, there will certainly be a DR3.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Just a thought...<BR>- <A HREF="mailto:dantheox@aol.com">Dan Vanderkam</A> </MULTICOL></BODY></HTML>
