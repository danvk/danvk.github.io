If you make the variables first, you'll wind up adding more, so you'llneed to switch back up anyway. Adding them to a routine after writing it is justa useful time saver</FONT></P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" WIDTH="100%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="4%"><FONT SIZE="5"><B>3</B></FONT></TD>		<TD WIDTH="96%"><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE>		</TD>	</TR></TABLE></P><P><FONT SIZE="4">&#160;If you find that you'll be using a piece of code quite often,just make it a method. This won't speed up your program any, but it will make ita lot easier for you to read, write, and modify.</FONT></P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" WIDTH="100%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="4%"><FONT SIZE="5"><B>4</B></FONT></TD>		<TD WIDTH="96%"><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE>		</TD>	</TR></TABLE></P><P><FONT SIZE="4">&#160;Being object oriented is a good idea—after all, that's thetype of language RB is. But keep in mind that this is only a good idea to a certainextent. For example, if you're going to be using a lot of toolbar buttons, go aheadand make a new canvas subclass. However, if you're only going to be using one, justput all the code directly into the canvas that will be the button. This will keepyour from having dozens of classes in your project—something that can become confusingVERY quickly.</FONT></P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" WIDTH="100%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="4%"><FONT SIZE="5"><B>5</B></FONT></TD>		<TD WIDTH="96%"><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE>		</TD>	</TR></TABLE></P><P><FONT SIZE="4">&#160;RB crashes. In fact, it crashes a lot. So, when you're testingyour program, be sure to save <B>very</B> often. A good idea is to teach yourselfthat the key combination to run a program is Cmd-S-R, not just Cmd-R.</FONT></P><P><A NAME="6"></A><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" WIDTH="100%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="4%"><FONT SIZE="5"><B>6</B></FONT></TD>		<TD WIDTH="96%"><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE>		</TD>	</TR></TABLE></P><P><FONT SIZE="4">&#160;When you're making a multiple column listbox, be sure torefresh the window and check the column placements (see picture) by clicking thewindowshade button twice. This gives you a better idea of how the columns will beplaced–a much better system than the previous guess-and-check setup.</FONT></BODY></HTML>
