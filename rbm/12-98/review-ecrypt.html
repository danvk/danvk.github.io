This particular pluginaims to provide simple, fast, and powerful encrypting/encoding through REALbasic,and it succeeds on all accounts.<IMG SRC="e-cryptencrypt.gif" WIDTH="158" HEIGHT="150"ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0"></P><P>&#160;&#160;At its base, encoding is fairly simple: taking data, changing it,and being able to change it back again. Simple as it may seem, there are an infinitenumber of ways to do it, ranging from full DSL encryption, all the way down to asimple &quot;change A to 1, B to 2, etc.&quot; system.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Though not as powerful as some forms of encryption, e-Crypt does avery good job of providing a simple and fast mechanism to encrypt data. Data encryptedwith e-crypt looks like gibberish, even after intense attempts to crack the code.Happy with the effectiveness of encryption, I went on to see how it was used.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Encryption and Decryption abilities are provided by two commands:Encrypt and Decrypt. These each take the same type of parameters, and either encryptor decrypt them (guess which one does which...). The four parameters are the actualdata to encrypt/decrypt, the number of bytes to affect (usually, all of them), thepassword, and the offset (where to start encrypting/decrypting). Using it, you canencrypt half of a file with one password, and the other half with a different one—andit wouldn't even be hard! That would sure confuse a lot of people...</P><P>&#160;&#160;However, the desired effect for encrypting a string is usually forthe <B>entire</B> string to be encrypted at the same time. The ability to set a startingpoint and offset is nice, but it would be even nicer if there were seperate commandsthat simply assumed that you wanted to use the whole string, and didn't force youto constantly type <TT>Encrypt text, len(text), &quot;•••••&quot;</TT>, 0 and insteadlet you type <TT>Encrypt text, &quot;•••••&quot;</TT>. However, if this is all Ihave to complain about, then this is certainly an excellent product. After all, youcould make a module that let you omit the extra parameters in about a minute.</P><P>&#160;&#160;e-Crypt isn't limited to encryptiing though! It can also <B>encode</B>strings. The encode methods take a string, and reformat it to only use certain characters—somethingthat can be VERY useful on the internet. If this sounds like binhexing to you, thenyou're right! The principles are basically the same, except that e-crypt gives youmore flexibility.</P><P>&#160;&#160;This plugin provides excellent encryption that is simple to use. Ihave almost no complaints about the performance and usability of e-Crypt, exceptfor the small, monospaced manual.So, for only $15, you can have powerful encryptionand encoding services in RB, and to top it all off, you'll get about a dozen otherexcellent plugins, many of which I hope to review in the future.<DIV ALIGN="RIGHT"><P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="240">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#99FF99"><B>&#160;Pros:</B> Provides effective, simple, powerful, customizable, and fast encryption/encoding			for a minimal cost.<BR>			<B>&#160;Cons:</B> Sparse documentation.
