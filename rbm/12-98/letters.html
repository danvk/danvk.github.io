I just wanted to drop you a not to commenton your RB Homepage.<BR>First off, I think it's great, strictly in principle alone. RB Monthly is informative,extremely well written and essential. The fact that you have source code availableas well is also a nice concept that for some reason REAL Software has overlooked.<TT>-Scott Keene</TT></FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&#160;&#160;<B>Thanks!</B></FONT></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">I was just reading your Extentions story on your 10/98 RBmonthly and I noticed that in the example image of changing the type to &quot;appe,&quot;the creator was &quot;ttxt.&quot; Making SimpleText in to an extention? Hmmm... <TT>-Cavykid</TT></FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>&#160;&#160;I've been caught! Nooo!!</B></FONT></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&#160;&#160;I was reading in your mag–it's great by theway–about sprites. The guy writing the tutorial said:<BR>&#160;&#160;&quot;We need to make a variable called '<TT>Guy as sprite</TT>'. Tomake it, we go to the edit menu and select 'New Variable...'&quot; Did I miss something?There is no &quot;New Variable...&quot; option in the edit menu. Please respond asI want to develop games and am highly interested in sprites. Thanks! <TT>-Perry Fjellman</TT></FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&#160;&#160;<B>Ooops! I meant &quot;New Property...&quot;</B><B>In reality, the command <I>should</I> be &quot;New Variable...&quot;, but RB isjust messed up that way.</B></FONT></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">I think Dave Mark's way to name variables is better thanyours :-)<BR><BR>You:<BR><TT>MyBigFruit as Fruit</TT><BR><BR>Dave:<BR><TT>myBigFruit as Fruit</TT><BR><BR>&#160;&#160;Why make the first letter lowercase? Well, if you set the first letterin all Methods, Classes and Functions to uppercase you'll see faster if it's a variable.You should check out the first chapters in Dave's book C on the Macintosh for somenice tips about naming stuff. <TT>-Gabriel</TT></FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><TT><B>&#160;&#160;</B></TT><B>Then again, it's not veryhard to distinguish the two in the first place. RB won't let you make variables withthe same names as methods, and in general, you know what variables you've made.<BR>&#160;&#160;Anyway, I guess it's just a matter of opinion...</B></FONT></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">I just read the most recent number of RB monthly, and Ifind it very interesting.<BR>As I realize that there's a lot of people reading your magazine, I thought I'd writeto you about this delicate matter: common programming mistakes in REALbasic applications.There are a few.<BR><BR>1) Windows bigger than 640x480. These don't fit on the screens of older macs likemine (which is three years old...)<BR>2) StaticText controls using 9 point system font. This is unreadable with many commonsystem fonts like BeBox and OpenStep. If you need smaller text, use Geneva 9 or 10.<BR><BR>I've seen LOTS of RB-made apps doing these mistakes.<BR><BR><TT>- Fabian Lidman</TT></FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&#160;&#160;<B>Good points! Also, avoid putting system fontsin bold, as Charcoal and Chicago Bold look absolutely horrid.</B></FONT></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR><BR>I've been skimming through a few issues of REALbasic Monthly, and would like to thankyou for the great resource. I'm JUST learning RB now, and have high hopes of gettinga few applications up and running in the office in the new year. (Oh, and thank you,thank you, thank you for that great article on sockets! I was digging around forinformation like that, and came across it in RB monthly completely by accident! <TT>–Mike Butcher</TT></FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><TT>&#160;&#160;</TT><B>Your welcome!

A socket control connectsto servers on the Internet using OT, a Serial control controls your serial interface(Printer port and modem port). <TT>– Samad</TT></FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&#160;&#160;<B>I wasn't aware that I was supposed to showthis.
