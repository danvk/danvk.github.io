In fact, I usethem as little as possible.  It's hard enough to work small glitches out of protocolthat I design, let alone bigger and more complex protocols such as Hotline and HTTP!<BR><BR>&#160;&#160;Lucky for us, as REALbasic programmers, along comes httpSocket!  Now,if anyone wants to code anything from simple file transfers to a full-fledged webbrowser, he or she can spend more time on the actual works of the program, insteadof trying to decipher the cryptic HTTP protocol.<BR><BR>&#160;&#160;httpSocket is extremely simple.  There is one method to receive a htmltext file, and one method to download any file.  It comes with a whole slew of eventsto help you add power to your program, whatever it may be.  It transfers data froman HTTP server to you in whatever fashion you may need it.  It is all very easy touse, and has some built-in methods for URL formatting, redirection, authentication,and headers to get you on your way towards making a browser to rival one forced ontothe desktop of millions of unsuspecting customers (hint, hint Internet Explorer).<I>[Jim's opinion of certain software companies do not neccesarily reflect  thoseof this magazine –Ed.]</I><BR><BR>&#160;&#160;Erm, maybe.<TT>&#160;&#160;</TT><I>–&#160;Jim Rodovich</I><BR></P><DIV ALIGN="RIGHT"><P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="240">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#99FF99"><B>&#160;Pros:</B> Easy to use.
