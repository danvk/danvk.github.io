RBM's last issue(and also it's first anniversary issue). Deciding to end RBM was a rather big descisionfor me, but I had been considering it for a long time. Very few people wrote forit, and more and more issues were being released late (as well as being written inthe last possible second by me). My summer is turning out to be significantly morebusy than I expected, so I finally decided to call it quits. I suppose it's my dutyto get sentimental about this, but I really don't feel that way. Instead, I get toremember how RBM went from a tiny June '98 issue to this humongous July '99 finale.</P><P>&#160;&#160;I got the idea for RBM on a really long car ride from New Jersey toIndiana. There really wasn't any way to get products reviewed, spread around tutorials,or give tips to a lot of RB users at the time. When I got back, I wrote the firstRBM in a couple of hours, and released it. Looking back, it really wasn't all thatmuch (and it had an absolutely horrible color scheme), but it set the basic styleof the magazine (tips, reviews, news). It didn't have any tutorials, and the coverstory was just about the fact that RB now had a plugin format.</P><P>&#160;&#160;I was rather disappointed when the only letter that I received wasa complaint from someone who had written a product that I reviewed. I went on withRBM anyway, and came out with the July issue, which was about RB hitting 1.0.</P><P>&#160;&#160;After this, I stopped RBM to gather up writers. I wound up gettingabout 6, but none of them ever wrote anything for RBM and I continued to make thewhole magazine. In the end, that was how most of the issues came out. Some featuredreviews by other people, but that was mainly because reviewing your own product israther questionable.</P><P>&#160;&#160;The August issue laid out the example that the rest of the issueswould all follow, with one large tutorial. I occasionally had more, but this wasusually how it worked. Interestingly enough, RB Monthly began somewhat of a cooperationwith REALgurus in the next issue. I changed my layout a bit (though it wasn't mainstreamyet), and they put a link to my site on their banner. There was some more to thedeal (such as them writing some articles for me), but like most things, that didn'tever work out.</P><P>&#160;&#160;After this, RBM cruised along with a few large and small delays. Thelayout became a good bit crisper, and each issue usually had more content. However,I still wrote just about everything. The May issue came out on time, but the Juneissue (now July) has been quite late. Sorry about that, but I've been quite busy.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Over the year that I've been writing RBM, REALbasic has grown froma small and free product into a full fledged commercial monstrosity. The need fortutorials and info on how to better use RB is probably even more important now thanit was 13 months ago, so I hope that I can continue to write some. However, thesewon't be particularly common, so don't expect much.</P><P>&#160;&#160;RBM has certainly been an interesting experience, and I hope thatRB programmers will continue to benefit from it long after this magazine has finished.</P><P>- <A HREF="mailto:dantheox@aol.com">Dan Vanderkam</A> </MULTICOL></BODY></HTML>
