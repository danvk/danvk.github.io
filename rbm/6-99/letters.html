To put your letter in thissection, just e-mail it on over to <A HREF="mailto:dantheox@aol.com">dantheox@aol.com</A>.I actually got a ton of letters this month! Wow! Keep 'em coming!</P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Every time a new issue of RB Monthly comes out, I get awarm, fuzzy feeling inside.</FONT><TT> - David Norton</TT></P><P><B>&#160;&#160;Wow! That's amazing!</B></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P>I have an app I have been working on for over a year and it has been crying fora database. That, and the new support for Win95/NT is swinging me rapidly to RB2.I had been really struggling with the database documentation and the whole issueof terminology (I am not familiar with data bases at all). The april issue of RBMonthlywas discovered at just the right time. I had not yet committed suicide!<B> </B><TT>-James Wagner</TT></P><P><B>&#160;&#160;You read it here folks—RBM stops people from commiting federalcrimes!</B></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P>First off, thanks to all of you at RBM. A great magazine, and a critical servicefor those of us newbies out in the developer community.</P><P><B>&#160;&#160;Thanks!</B></P><P>I particularly enjoyed your article on making an RB application AppleScriptable.One thing that the author did not comment on was extending RB's object model. Infact, there was no comment on RB's object model at all; as far as I can tell, youcan't write a standard applescript to retrieve, for example, &quot;the name of window1&quot;.</P><P><B>&#160;&#160;This isn't a bug. RB doesn't store the actual name of a windowor control—just a reference to it. This speeds up code execution.</B></P><P>You can use RB to send object specifiers, but you can't use it to parse them.I don't see any methods that allow the developer to intercept or patch AE managercalls for ospec resolution, so I assume that this feature is just not supported yet.Of course, it's possible to work around this by coding a new appleevent for everycore event, but...<TT> - &quot;RPeters137&quot;</TT></P><P><B>&#160;&#160;Like I said, AppleEvents can get complicated... =)</B></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P>&#160;&#160;Great idea for an electronic newsletter for the Realbasic community.I'm a *very* beginner programmer (but a designer of almost 10 years) and haven'tyet purchased a full version of Realbasic, but am seriously considering it to dabbleand create basic apps for myself and others. <BR>&#160;&#160;I'd love to see a &quot;Beginner's Section&quot; in your newsletter,describing some basic methods of programming. I don't get a sense of completenesswith the manuals supplied with Realbasic, and will probably just hack through untilthe trial period is over and give up. No decent manuals make it VERY tough to learnthis stuff. Back to original thought. How about a beginners section helping us lowlybegineers learn this stuf? –&#160;D<FONT SIZE="1">AVID</FONT> J<FONT SIZE="1">ANIK</FONT>-J<FONTSIZE="1">ONES</FONT></P><P><B>&#160;&#160;Thanks! I don't know if I'll add a beginners section, but thereare tons of tutorials around the internet. A good place to start is </B><A HREF="http://www.realgurus.com"><B>www.realgurus.com</B></A><B>,or the web ring.</B> <HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P><BR>&#160;&#160;I've just bought RealBasic. Your newsletter has been very useful.<BR>&#160;&#160;Maybe I've misunderstood your points but I disagree with your complaintsabout multiple versions of RB, what with the release version and DR2 bleeding edgeversion. I think it's highly desirable to have a stable release version and a separateone in development. If I'm writing an application I don't want to be simultaneouslydebugging an RB beta. – G<FONT SIZE="1">OWAN</FONT></P><P><B>&#160;After experiencing constant crashes whenever I RAN A PROGRAM in DR2,I have a new appreciation for the stabler versions. However, I still think that chaosisn't the way to go for version numbers. (yes, chaos is the right word. F9 can'topen projects that have been saved in DR2)</B></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P>&#160;&#160;It is good to see such interest in REALBasic. I think that this productis going to catch fire and be the top choice in rapid application development. Whenit does, this eMag will be our viewport into classes and techniques available. Keepup the good work! –A<FONT SIZE="1">ARON</FONT> B<FONT SIZE="1">RATCHER</FONT></P><P><B>&#160;&#160;Thanks!</B></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P>I was having problems building the chat application listed in this months RB monthlyand was wondering if there was a completed version somewhere that I could downloadand look at to compare to what I had?&#160;—&#160;K<FONT SIZE="1">YLE</FONT> P<FONTSIZE="1">AULEY</FONT></P><P><B>&#160;&#160;The completed version isn't on the internet. However, Brian Jones'page (it's mentioned earlier in the letters) has an even better example called &quot;ChatterClient&quot;. It supports multiple connections. Also, </B><A HREF="http://www.realgurus.com/"><B>REALgurus</B></A><B>should have a socket tutorial on their site soon.</B></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P>Louis Chartrand in your April letters section said that he has a 603e to do mostof his dev work on. Well, I use an LC 575 to do most of my dev work on, with a 68LC040,20 megs of RAM, and a 640 by 480 screen. I also use a Performa 6400 with 28.8 modem,OS 8.5, 88 MB of RAM, and a 28.8 modem to test it on and download stuff. Just thoughtyou might like to know. BTW, RBM rocks!<TT> - David Norton, Jr.</TT></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P>You show a circle with a radius of 1 and an angle of 47.3 deg. off the horizontaldiameter. You then go on to state that the value of sin(47.3) is equal to the x coordinate.Are you sure that the value is not the y coordinate?<BR><BR>I believe that as shown that sin(47.3)=y/r, and since r=1 then sin(47.3)=y<BR><BR>I am a 77 yr. old newbie - do enjoy your contributions very much.</P><P>&#160;<B>You're right. The cosine is the x coordinate, and sine is the y coordinate.I always get these confused...</B></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P><I>[On the April Fools editorial...]</I> I can only speak for myself, but I thinkmy opinion is probably<BR>shared, when I say: Don't ever, ever, do that again.<TT> - Antaeus Feldspar</TT></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P>I didn't hear back from you after we'd talked about doing the ChartPart review,so only discovered today that you'd done and published it!</P><P>I was a little disappointed by the review, but grateful for the feedback. Pleaseallow me to address<BR>a couple of issues:<BR><BR>* Your critique that ChartPart only handles one-dimensional data (can't do comparisons)is on-target. I'll work toward addressing that in the next release.</P><P>* The price: it is too high if all you're doing is a single type of graph (unlessit's the pie chart, which is a big pain in the hinder). Of course, most people getto use it for free, even that could be argued. But I think $20 is fair if you'rewanting to be able to use a variety of charts without having to do all the peskymath yourself. I usually charge about $60/hour for consulting work, so if I saved20 minutes of time, it would have been worth it for me. :)<BR><BR>* Can only draw onscreen: Absolutely false! It prints and copies to the clipboardwith the built in classes, and you can also pass it any graphic object (includingoffscreen ones) to have it draw to. If you had the idea that it only draws onscreen,then my docs are inadequate somewhere.<BR><BR>* Only one color for all parts of a pie chart: Addressed in v1.1, a free upgradefor all registered users.<BR><BR>Thanks for the feedback! I'll certainly take it into consideration as I work on futurerevisions.<BR><BR>Best wishes, Sean McCains</P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P>I just noticed that my PrefContainer class got reviewed. I wanted to get a fewerrors fixed. if possible. My name is spelled wrong in two places, it should be SteveLoBasso Also my web page is not listed, it should be: <A HREF="http://members.tripod.com/~slobasso/programming/rb.html">http://members.tripod.com/~slobasso/programming/rb.html</A>I would appreciate these changes, but I understand if this can't be done.<TT> -SteveLoBasso</TT></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P>I really liked the Sockets story for the Sept.98 issue. However, when i trieddoing it by instantiating the sockets entirely in code, I couldn't do it. As muchas I read the DevGuide and Language Ref, I couldn't make it instantiate a socketin code only. I couldn't even get it to compile correctly.</P><P>So here is a simple request: If possible, could you do a Sockets revisited article?One where you rebuild the 1-1 chat program without dragging a socket control intoa window? That would probably give myself and all those people on rb-pro-g that havebeen asking about sockets a better idea. If this is too difficult, let me know. Ihope Alex [Duncan]'s forth coming book has some info on this subject.</P><P>Among the benefits of this I think, would be that it would give people an ideahow coding works when you don't have the nice pretty interface builder. I mean, Inormally wouldn't think that a socket would be something you would tie to a specificwindow, or should have to tie to a window, so, how do I do it?</P><P>Thanks for RBM and all the other answers to people I have seen you post to thelists.<TT> - Lindsay Adams</TT></P><P><B>&#160;&#160;It's certainly a good idea. It didn't make it into this issue,but I'll consider updating the article outside of RBM.</B></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P>I've just started learning REalBasic, and have found your site to be incrediblyhelpful . I see that you won't be adding anything now... I understand the work thatmust take, and do not question your decision, I was just writing to ask if plan onkeeping your site up for a while. I haven't had a chance to suck all of the infoout yet and don't want to see it go away!<TT> - John Murden</TT></P><P><B>&#160;&#160;The RBM site will be up for a long time to come, so don't worry.</B></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P>Just heard about RealBasic Monthly and wanted to thank you for all the tutorialsand information you provided us (RealBasic Users). I also want to apologize, I wasone who offered to submit articles to RBM but never produce. I hope you understandthat my first priority is my job and that it takes me away from RealBasic for weeksat a time. ie: The last project took 3 weeks to complete! I just turned on my Macand hear about RBM. Again Thank You!<TT> - John Nunez</TT></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P>I am really new to RB. As a matter of face I just started Last night. With thehelp of your site I actually wrote something that worked within minutes of findingyour site. I want to thank you for that. Also I just want to tell you that it istoo bad that you are not going to be continuing the RB monthly thing that I saw onyour site. It looks to be very interesting and useful. That brings me to anotherpoint of this mail. I was trying to download the PDFs of the past issues, and itsays that the page can not be found.</P><P>Where can I get a copy of these? Thank you again.<TT> - Devin Trotter</TT></P><P><B>&#160;&#160;Not all the issues have PDFs online yet. Sorry.</B></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P>I am sorry that you are going to discontinue your wonderful magazine. I am newto RB (6 weeks about) and have found that the only real true help with working inthe environment have been from your Monthly. If I knew more I'm write for you, (I know that doesn't count) I am a journalist student, but I feel you actually haveto know how to use the environment to be useful. Would you consider doing your publicationon a quarterly basis? There are a lot of people like me who need you.<TT> - Nancie</TT></P><P><B>&#160;&#160;As I've said before, my descision is final, though I may add morearticles later or even write for another publication.</B></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P>I was very pleased to find your article about Writing a Screen Saver in RB. Howeverwhen I tried to download the file MenuBarMagic from your article (.../rbm/4-99/screensaver.html)I got a message saying that this file does not exist... I tried as well to locateunsuccessfully the XCMD on the different servers... On the other hand, I could notfind as well the &quot;RB Cafe&quot;...</P><P>Maybe you know were I could find the necessary files to try out your routine...Sincerely yours, J.C. Martinez</P><P><B>&#160;&#160;To go to the RB Caf&#233;, download Hotline from www.hotlinesw.com,and go to cafe.realbasic.com. It should be in the XCMDs folder.</B></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P>I am a brand new user of REALbasic, I have BASIC and C+ programming experiancebut am unfamiliar with the Mac toolbox or REALbasic's command structure. Do you knowif there is a book out (or soon to come out) along the lines of &quot;Teach YourselfREALbasic in 24 hours, or 1 week, or something like that?&quot; I thrive on bookslike that and find that they really help. I taught myself HTML 4.0 with one of thoseand learned quickly. Anyway, any info you may have would be greatly appreciated.Thank You.<TT> - Brian Alston</TT></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P>Sorry to hear that the next issue of the magazine will be the last. I've reallyenjoyed it. It was really helpful when I was a RB newbie, and now that I'm more proficientI really appreciated your insightful reviews, editorials, and tips &amp; tricks.</P><P>I'm the technical editor of a magazine for FileMaker Pro (database software),and I KNOW that tons of people PROMISE to write, while very few actually do.</P><P>Continued success in all your ventures. Sincerely, Bob Cusick</P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P>There is a need for RB Monthly! Do *not* kill it! Sometimes, after I've been ona long vacation or something like that, I find myself lost in the REALbasic world&lt; I have absolutely no idea of what has happend to RB during the last couple ofweeks. So what do I do? I go to http://www.nd.edu/~jvanderk/rbm/ and read myselfup to date! The RB Monthly news-page is awesome. Or was. Please do not kill RB Monthly!</P><P>RB Monthly is far better than REAL Wizards ever will be!</P><P>If you don't have time to write the whole magazine, then why don't you at leastwrite the news and perhaps the reviews? Best regards, Jonatan Uppstrom</P><P><B>Well, there's always REALnews, which is much more thorough than my news section.There's a link at the end of this month's news.</B></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P>It is with great disapointment that I read your notice on your web page in regardsto the discontinuation of the RB Monthly Online Mag. I have used this resource inumberabletimes in my efforts to get my head around REALbasic, and I have found it to be oneof the top sites for real information about common problems we hit in programming.</P><P>As a fully registered (profressional version) user of Real Basic, I have reliedupon the information on the web to help me out of situations I have found myselfin whilst taking steps into the REAL world of coding.</P><P>So it is with a heavy heart that I bid your site farewell. I fully understandthat you have a life apart from maintaining this site, but it is a shame that youcould not get the support required. I feel that RB Monthly is a valuable resoucefor the Real basic community and it would be a great crime to let it disappear dueto peoples apparent lack of interest.</P><P>In summary, if you do decide to stick with your decsion and stop publication ofRB Monthly, apart from the fact that I would personally be upset, I am sure thatthere are hundreds, maybe thousands of other Real Users out their who would feelthe same. Please remember to keep your head high, and thank you for helping me onmy journey to learn REALbasic. All the best, Darren Miller</P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P>Sorry to hear that the next issue will be the last. I started following RB Monthlya few issues ago, when I first got into REALbasic, and it has taught me a lot ofthings and really got my interest in REALbasic going. The problem with publicationson the web is that the writers rarely get feedback/thanks - people just go and grabwhat they can but I'd just like to say thanks for your effort, it has been appreciated.<TT>- Gavin Smith</TT></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P>Hi Dan,<BR><BR>The tutorial on making your application applescriptable was excellent. Also goodto see you showed people how to use Resourceror.</P><P>As for your editorial comments re REAL SW -- you may be interested in some backgroundinformation:</P><P>REAL were contractually obliged to ship 2.0 by the a certain date in April (youno doubt laughed when REAL promised 2.0 for Q1 99, right? Well, apparently they werea little overconfident...) Now they have to maintain the fiction that 2.0 was 2.0and not DR2r83.</P><P>Aside from that, nothing has really changed. New DR2s ship every couple of days.</P><P>2.0.2 was a pretty solid version, and most of the &quot;nicely numbered&quot;releases have been release quality (assuming OS8.x and Mac-side). 2.1 is supposedto offer final database functionality; 2.2 is supposed to offer complete multimediastuff (QuickTime, sprites, canvases, sound, etc. working and cross-platform). I'dguess that 2.2 will probably ship around September/October (I won't bother quotingyou the times REAL told me).</P><P>The basic underlying issue is that REAL expected to have a second full-time programmerworking for them starting a few months ago, but the person they hired became a no-showfor complicated legal reasons (not REAL's fault). Combine this with the fact thatREAL's entire staff is incapable of (a) processing bug reports (so Andrew and hiswife are doing that _as well_); (b) keeping documentation even vaguely in touch withreality; or (c) keeping their accounts straight, and there's your explanation. -Anonymous by request</BODY></HTML>
