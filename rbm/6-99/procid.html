This allows you to escape the limitations of the &quot;Frame&quot;property by giving you many, many more window types to choose from. Here's whereyou enter it:</P><P><IMG SRC="procid.gif" WIDTH="193" HEIGHT="60" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P><P>&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, you don't get a popup menu–you have to enter a number.This number can represent a variety of things.

To create a custom type of window,you can use a WDEF resource (they're in quite a few applications). To do this, copythe resource into your compiled application. Then, make the procID its resource IDtimes 16. That's it! Now you can have incredibly bizarre windows of any type! I tookthe WDEF resource out of Kaleidoscope 1.5's BeBox scheme, and made a window in anRB-made app look like this:</P><P><IMG SRC="image23.gif" WIDTH="217" HEIGHT="125" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P><P>&#160;&#160;It's not too tough, and it's <B>incredibly</B> useful.</BODY></HTML>
