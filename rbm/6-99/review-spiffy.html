Programs like Photoshopedit these. But the other type of image is much more useful in many ways. It cangenerate smaller files, look as good as a printer can possibly print it (no matterwhat the DPI), and actual shapes in them can be edited–even after they're drawn.<IMGSRC="spiffy.gif" WIDTH="238" HEIGHT="179" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0"></P><P>&#160;&#160;Creating a program that can edit vector images however, is far fromsimple. To spare you the difficulty of writing such a program, Jim Rodovich has createdSpiffyVector.</P><P>&#160;&#160;SpiffyVector provides all the basics of a vector image editor: polygons,fills, transparency, selections, rezizing, etc. The SpiffyVector class also goesbeyond this, providing the ability to rotate polygons and include text in the graphic(this ability is quite limited though).</P><P>&#160;&#160; <TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="49%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#99FF99"><B>&#160;Pros:</B> Provides easy-to-use vector image support. Allows undoing. Allows			different fill and border colors. Lets you save info to a string.<BR>			<B>&#160;Cons:</B> Can't render to any picture at a scaled size. Selections are too			strict. Must save colors and points seperately. No Beziers. 			<TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="100%">				<TR>					<TD WIDTH="22%"><B>Rating:</B></TD>					<TD WIDTH="78%"><B>7.5</B><BR>						<IMG SRC="star.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="*" BORDER="0"><IMG						SRC="star.gif" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="*" BORDER="0"><IMG SRC="star.gif"						WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="*" BORDER="0"><IMG SRC="star.gif" WIDTH="32"						HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="*" BORDER="0"></TD>				</TR>			</TABLE>		</TD>	</TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
