On July 12 (which happens to be this writersbirthday), Andrew sent this letter to the RB Mailing lists:</P><BLOCKQUOTE>	<P>Dear Users,<BR>	<BR>	After much consideration I have decided to submit my resignation to REAL Software.	September 1st will be my last day. This was a difficult decision for me but I have	decided that I need to spend more time with my girls and to pursue other projects.</P>	<P>I will miss working on REAL Basic, but not as much as I will miss all of the people	that I have had a chance to get to know as a result. I know that all of you will	wish me well, just as I wish all of you well.</P>	<P>Thank you for your past and continuing support of REAL Basic.</P>	<P>Best Wishes<BR>	Andrew</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>&#160;&#160;After much discussion on the lists, REAL SW attempted to calm fearswith this letter:</P><BLOCKQUOTE>	<P>I'm sure all of you were surprised to hear of Andrew's resignation and are wondering	what this means for the future of REALbasic. First, let me reassure you that REAL	Software will continue to sell, support and develop REALbasic and to do our part	to help the REALbasic community survive and thrive. We are more committed to this	now than ever before.<BR>	<BR>	It was our intention from the beginning to build an engineering team. This process	had already begun and will continue. A team allows the distribution of responsibilities	and speeds development. This is especially true for a product like REALbasic that	is so internally modular. The original plan was for Andrew to head this team and	continue to be responsible for its direction. That part of the plan will, of course,	be changing. Andrew and I recently outlined versions 2.1, 2.5 and 3.0 of REALbasic	so his original vision for what REALbasic would become is intact. And as we have	done in the past, we will continue to ask each of you for your input so that REALbasic	will continue to be what you want it to be.<BR>	<BR>	REAL Software is financially healthy. We are a privately held company so I won't	go into the details. However, we were profitable last year (with only half a year	of sales and a years worth of expenses) and we are even more profitable this year	and are debt free. We run a pretty tight ship here and as a result, have the financial	resources to put a new engineering team into place.<BR>	<BR>	Andrew's last day at REAL Software will be September 1st, 1999 which is the date	we are planning to ship REALbasic 2.1. The goal of this release will be to improve	reliability and to finish existing features that are not supported by the Windows	compiler. It is important to us that each of you feel that REALbasic is strong and	solid.<BR>	<BR>	All of us here at REAL Software wish Andrew well in his next endeavor.<BR>	<BR>	Geoff Perlman<BR>	President and CEO<BR>	REAL Software, Inc.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>&#160;&#160;This undoubtedly will mean some major changes in RB. However, we allwish Andrew Barry the best and commend him for his years of singlehanded work onCrossBasic and REALbasic.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">e-CryptIt ecrypts more</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE></P><P>&#160;&#160;Einhuger Software's 5-star e-CryptIt product has had several revisions.It now supports binhex, base64, MacBinary, and UUencode.

After this, you can use all the normal drawing commandson the mask with Picture.Mask.Graphics. You can't directly set the mask, but youcan use a DrawPicture command to draw a picture into it.
