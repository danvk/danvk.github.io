Here are an unbelieveable 6 tips!</FONT><H2>Tip #1 - Morph BevelButtons</H2><P>&#160;&#160;The bevel button control can obviously be used as a button. However,if you set its bevel property to something higher than 2, you can turn it into anytype of appearance manager control! These include group boxes, Spin buttons, flippytriangles, and a whole lot more. Only a few are very useful, but here are all thepossible values:</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="100%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="9%">0-2</TD>		<TD WIDTH="91%">Small, Medium, and Large bevelbuttons</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="9%">16</TD>		<TD WIDTH="91%">A slider with a left facing thumb.</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="9%">20</TD>		<TD WIDTH="91%">A slider with a right facing thumb.</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="9%">24</TD>		<TD WIDTH="91%">A slider with a rectangular thumb.</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="9%">32</TD>		<TD WIDTH="91%">A right facing flippy triangle.</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="9%">33</TD>		<TD WIDTH="91%">A left facing flippy triangle.</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="9%">48</TD>		<TD WIDTH="91%">A progressbar</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="9%">64</TD>		<TD WIDTH="91%">A spin button</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="9%">80</TD>		<TD WIDTH="91%">Spinning arrows</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="9%">96</TD>		<TD WIDTH="91%">A placard</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="9%">112</TD>		<TD WIDTH="91%">A seperator bar</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="9%">128</TD>		<TD WIDTH="91%">A groupbox</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="9%">129</TD>		<TD WIDTH="91%">A groupbox with a checkbox.

Using a template such as Resorcerer's, you can make this resource containa string, point to a string elsewhere in the file, use styled text, or even containa picture!<BR clear = "left"><H2><BR>Tip #3 - Put non-controls in a window</H2><P><IMG SRC="class11.gif" WIDTH="233" HEIGHT="96" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0">&#160;&#160;In2.x, you can put just about anything in a window—even a class that has nothing todo with a control. Doing this makes it much easier for you to access the class'sproperties and methods. And, as an added bonus, if you click the &quot;Visible&quot;checkbox in the properties dialog, you can make the class's properties appear inthe properties window! Now if only that worked for control subclasses…</P><H2>Tip #4 - Draw a window</H2><P><B>&#160;&#160;</B>In 2.x, every window sports a new method: DrawInto. This methodtakes three parameters: a graphics object, and an x and y coordinate. Using it, youcan draw the content of the window into a graphics object.</P><H2>Tip #5 - Use Graphics Exporting</H2><P>&#160;&#160;A new feature in 2.1 is the QTGraphicsExporter class. Using this,you can easily save a picture object into a file using a variety of formats. Andunlike the ExportPicture function, they don't require you to show a save dialog (thoughyou can). To create a graphics exporter, use the GetQTGraphicsExporter function.It takes a four letter string which corresponds to the type code of the file thatyou want to save. For example, PICT is for PICT, JPEG is for JPEG, and so on. Afterthis, you can use the rest of the class's methods to manipulate the image, and eventuallysave it:</P><UL>	<LI><TT>HasSettingsDialog As Boolean</TT> - True if a settings dialog exists for	the file format.	<LI><TT>RequestSettings As Boolean</TT> - When this method is called, the settings	dialog for the image type is shown. Returns true if the user clicks OK, false if	they click Cancel.	<LI><TT>DefaultExtension As String</TT> - The default extension for the file format	(ie, &quot;.jpg&quot;)	<LI><TT>DesiredTargetDataSize As Integer</TT> - The size of the file when it's saved.	<LI><TT>CompressionQuality As Integer</TT> - How much to compress the image.	<LI><TT>OutputFileType As String</TT> - Four letter type code of the file.	<LI><TT>OutputFileCreator As String</TT> - Four letter creator code of the file.	<LI><TT>SavePicture(location As Folder, image As Picture) As Boolean</TT> - Saves	the picture to location. Returns true if it works.</UL><H2>Tip #6 - Put a placard behind a window</H2><P><IMG SRC="lasttip.gif" WIDTH="123" HEIGHT="93" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0">&#160;&#160;Plaindocument windows don't really look that great in OS 8. To spruce them up, many programsput a placard at the back of the window to give it a beveled look. This is easy enoughto do in RB (see the screenshot), and it'll really improve the look of the window.</P><P>&#160;&#160;There is one problem though: it may not seem possible to select thewindow itself (after all, there isn't any space that doesn't have a control). Fearnot though, simply click on a control, and then shift-click to deselect it. The windowis now editable from the properties window.</P><H2>Tip #7 - Use LockLeft, LockRight, etc.</H2><P>&#160;&#160;Making a window resize correctly is a pain.You have to manually writecode in the resize event to move and change the size of each control. Right? Nope!All controls have four properties that will help you: LockLeft, LockRight, LockTop,and LockBottom. How do they work? Pretty simple. This diagram should help. Left isLockLeft, Right is LockRight, and so on. Bot stands for Bottom and Rgt stands forright.</P><P><IMG SRC="lock.gif" WIDTH="368" HEIGHT="239" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P><P>&#160;&#160;If we set the Lock properties as this window instructs us, all thebuttons will resize on their own.</P><P>&#160;&#160;What do the values stand for? They LOCK the distance from the edgethat you specify. For example, the bottom right button will always be the exact samedistance from the bottom edge and the right edge if its LockRight and LockBottomproperties are checked. What if LockTop and LockBottom are both checked? The controlwill resize, just like the controls that aren't on corners do in this window. Thisshould save you a LOT of code, but if you stlill need to use the Resize event, rememberthat controls with Lock properties checked are resized before Resized is fired.</BODY></HTML>
