Thanks			to Geoff, who has given me the release notes for verisons 4-30 something, I've been			able to make a list of some of the biggest changes, and coolest new features. </FONT><BR>			<BR>			&#160;&#160;<FONT SIZE="4">The only new features in the first few versions were things			we take for granted now, such as the sin and cos functions, but these new features			quickly became incredible new features that made CrossBasic a great language. For			example, XCMD and XCFN support were added early on, thus making CrossBasic expandable.			Then came what some might say is one of the best features: AppleScript support.

It was back to tab in less than a week.<BR>			3) In r24, the HTML language reference was updated to 40 pages. The new prined documentation			that you can order is a whole <B>600</B> pages.

For the implications of this release on us and the mac, be sure to			read the editor's note. The clean fresh feeling of a whole version number won't last			long however, DR2 will be coming soon after the upcoming release of 1.0 (which should			come after F1 or F2).</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
