One of the best is the CTable set. At first,it's confusing exactly which item's you're supposed to download (There are at leastfive of them!), so to be safe, I downloaded them all. After I unstuffed them all,I found out that I only needed one of them, and that every single stuffed file hadcome with all five classes (this system could be made <B>much</B> better…). However,after I ran the demo project, I got excited. This was a program that did complexlistboxes, and allowed you to sort by column. Plus, it could sort numerically andin either direction.</P><P>&#160;&#160;I quickly read the readme and looked at the documentation (it's inE-Help format, which means you have to download yet another application. Also, thereare better help formats out there, like Apple Guide. Personally, I'd have prefereda Simple Text document.). It explained that you had to create a canvas control, aneditfield, and a scrollbar. Then, you set the Canvas's super to CTableControl, andmade it point to the editfield and scrollbar using its focusControl and VScrollbarproperties. Though I found this a bit odd, the manual expained that at this point,that was unavoidable for a class.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="100%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="44%"><IMG SRC="image25.gif" WIDTH="192" HEIGHT="139" ALIGN="TOP" BORDER="0"><BR>			<BR>			<B>An example CTable.</B> Notice how the columns are aligned differently, and they			are sorted numerically by age.</TD>		<TD WIDTH="56%">&#160;&#160;After setting the control up, it was only a simple matter of setting			the number of rows and columns, setting the column labels, and adding rows. One of			the most annoying things about the Listbox built-in to RB is adding rows to a multiple			column listbox. You can use the addrow property for the first column, but then you			use the Cell property for the rest. CTable handles it even worse! Even if there's			only one column, you still have to use the &quot;SetCell&quot; method, which takes			four parameters. This could be improved upon greatly, especially considering that			the last parameter is almost <B>always</B> false. (Actually, I have improved upon			it. My custom control, CTableExtender, provides some more intuitive ways of working			with CTable)</TD>	</TR></TABLE></P><P>&#160;&#160;Anyway, I ran the program, and was pleased to see everything showup. Then, I clicked on a column header (which <B>should</B> sort the list), but nothinghappened. I then realized that I had to manually make it sort. This could also beimproved on. However, after I finished writing the basic code for the CTable in mytest project, it was quite enjoyable. It let me set the justification (left, center,or right) for columns, and even let me set the style (e.g. bold italic) for individualcells.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Once you finish setting up CTable, this control adds a lot to yourprojects, and is extremely useful.</P><DIV ALIGN="RIGHT"><P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="49%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#99FF99"><B>&#160;Pros:</B> Powerful table control.
