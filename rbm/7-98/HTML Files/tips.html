In this issue, I'veadded some sections that are more &quot;How To&quot; oriented, such as How to usethe scroll method. If this disturbs you, then live with it.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="6">Tip #1 - </FONT><FONT SIZE="5">How to use the Scroll Method</FONT></P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="100%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="274">&#160;One of the more interesting changes in r36 was the addition of a Canvas.Scroll			method. Here's the syntax:<TT><BR>			<BR>			&#160;&#160;Scroll(deltaX as integer, deltaY as integer, left as integer, top as			integer, width as integer, height as integer, scrollControls as Boolean) </TT><BR>			<BR>			&#160;&#160;This method allows you to a canvas to scroll easily. Essentially, what			it does is to change the coordinates for the Canvas, i.e. the top left is -10, 5			instead of 0,0. More interesting than this is the <TT>scrollControls</TT> property.			The reference says that this determines whether or not controls on top of the canvas			scroll as well. To try this out, I whipped up a simple project that used the scroll			method. Screenshots can be found to your right.<BR>			<BR>			&#160;&#160;The code for the scroll button at the right is this:<BR>			<BR>			<TT>Canvas1.Scroll 100, 0</TT><BR>			<BR>			&#160;&#160;This one line hides all five controls over the canvas just as effectively			as uses five <TT>Control.Visible=False</TT> statements. If you had tried this with			a group box, it wouldn't have worked. This is an excellent way to group and move			controls, and it is also a good way to manipulate graphics.</TD>		<TD WIDTH="175"><IMG SRC="Scroll1.gif" WIDTH="174" HEIGHT="103" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"><BR>			<BR>			<IMG SRC="Scroll2.gif" WIDTH="174" HEIGHT="103" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"><BR>			<B><I>Before and After</I>.</B><FONT SIZE="2"> The controls haven't been hidden,			they've just been scrolled off the right edge of the canvas that they're on. This			would've taken five lines of code normally, but with scroll, it's only one.</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE></P><P><FONT SIZE="6">Tip #2</FONT><FONT SIZE="5"> - Don't restart, Interrupt!</FONT></P><P>&#160;&#160;One of the nastiest things about RB is how much it crashes, especiallywith &quot;Type 10&quot; errors. It displays a black and white box that lets yourestart. However, if you can still move the mouse, then there is hope!!! Simply pressCommand-Power (not Cmd-Ctrl-Power) to go into Interrupt mode (if you have MacBugsinstalled, then you'll drop to that). A new window will come up with a greater thansign. Simply type &quot;G FINDER&quot; to go back to the finder and quit RB withoutrestarting the whole computer. If it works, then save the rest of the stuff you haveopen before opening RB again. This trick works for apps besides RB too.</P><P><FONT SIZE="6">Tip #3</FONT><FONT SIZE="5"> - Use Confirm, and InputBox classes</FONT></P><P>&#160;&#160;&#160;RealBasic does have a MsgBox method, but it lacks some otherfeatures that Visual Basic has built-in: A confirm function (This is integrated intothe MsgBox function in VB), and an InputBox function. Fortunately, with RB's greatclass system, it's easy to make these on your own. Simply make two windows: One fora confirm box (w/ a yes and no button), and one for an input box.</P><P>&#160;&#160;&#160;I could explain how to do this further, but I've decided tospare you the boredom. If you downloaded this issue as a StuffIt archive, then youalready have these classes (in the Confirm and InputBox) folder. If you're viewingthis on the internet, <A HREF="confirm.sit.hqx">click here</A> to download them asa binhexed file.</BODY></HTML>
