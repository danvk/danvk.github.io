For example, we've <A			HREF="meetstaff.html">added new people</A> to our staff, such as Chris Daley, our			new artist. An addition I'm particularly proud of is the new patterns, such as the			background one here. They're all by me, and I think they're great! Also, I've added			several new sections to the magazine. There's now a &quot;Current Releases&quot;			section that keeps you informed of new releases of products that have been reviewed			in old issues. There's also a &quot;How To&quot; section that shows you how to do			neat things in RB. Also, I've added some &quot;Every Month&quot; features to the			magazine, which are in the news section (they have a red background instead of black).			For example, there's a list of all the RB updates in the past month.<BR>			<BR>			&#160;&#160;Well, enough about the magazine, lets talk about RealBasic!!! This has			been a big month for RB, and one that's been a long time in coming. When RealBasic			was CrossBasic (it changed to RB at r28), it was shareware. Since it changed, it's			been public beta. It's been in this beta state for over a year now, and by golly,			it was time for a change. Version 1.0, whcih was release June &lt;date&gt;, is probably			about the biggest event there's been for this here programming language since it			changed from CB to RB (that was more than a name change). Now that it's no longer			in public beta, RealBasic has incredible potential. Here's how I see it:<BR>			<BR>			&#160;&#160;So far, RB has been mentioned in MacWeek. Now that it's been released			though, it could hit a lot of mac magazines, from</TD>		<TD WIDTH="50%" VALIGN="TOP">MacWorld to MacAddict. With it's increased publicity, RB will gain popularity quickly.			There are two reasons for this. One is that it's easy to use. We've had Basic on			the mac for a while with FutureBasic, but it was too complicated. Command lines are			NOT in style! RealBasic however, is very easy to learn, but it has quite a bit of			power. Also, it is graphical, like Visual Basic. RB could appeal to people who are			interested in writing software for macs, and C programmers looking for easier alternatives.<BR>			<BR>			&#160;&#160;RB also has potential for businesses. For many companies, Visual Basic			allows them to make specialized software for their clients. However, since there			is no such thing as VB for Macs (then again, with this Microsoft alliance, who knows?),			they can't make software quickly and easily for macs. This makes them disregard the			mac users as an insignificant percent of the computer market. However, if RB can			import Visual Basic projects quickly and easily, then this situation would change			drastically. Now, they could write software for many, many Mac users with almost			no extra effort. All they'd need is a copy of RB Pro, which will be a bargain for			$299. If there's more software available for macs, then more and more people will			see the mac as a legitimate platform, and start using it.<BR>			<BR>			&#160;&#160;So, in conclusion, RealBasic has incredible potential to help companies,			and the Mac.<BR><BR>&#160;&#160;- Dan Vanderkam<BR>			&#160;&#160;&#160;writer, editor, publisher, etc.</TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;</BODY></HTML>
