In previous versions that supported plugins (see <A HREF="..\6-98\pluginnews.html">BigNews</A>, 6/98), if you tried to build an application that used a plugin, it wouldgive you a &quot;Bad Export&quot; error. I know that I for one have been waitinganxiously for this to be included, and I know that many others have too.<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;If you remember <A HREF="../6-98/review-madplug.html">MadPlug</A>—aplugin that received a four-star review last month, there are three player programs.One of them exists (MiniMad, by me), and two have been delayed in their release forseveral weeks now (SinPlayer, by Tim Spalone, and MadPlayer). Haha!. Anyway, MiniMadshows, and I'm sure the other two will show what can be done with MadPlug.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#0099FF">PowerPC compression</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#0066FF"><BR></FONT>&#160;&#160;New in DR1r38 was the ability for PowerPC applications to be compressed.The release notes said this fairly bluntly, so I decided to try a test. I took MiniMAD,an application of mine that allows you to play MAD files, and compiled it w/o compression.The actual file size was a whopping 712,491 bytes (696K). Then, I compiled it, andchecked the &quot;Compress&quot; box. The Build Application dialog cleverly indicatedthat the application's RAM requirements would be raised by 600K. This time, the applicationwas 387,611 bytes (379K)–nearly half the original size.<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;This new option has proven itself to me to be a great feature,but keep in mind that if the application you're working with is small, then the saveddisk space might not be worth the extra RAM.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#0099FF">My next adventure with VB importing</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#0066FF"><BR></FONT>&#160;&#160;&#160;The DR1r38 release notes also said that the VB importerwas now compatible with Visual Basic 2.0 and higher. As Geoff pointed out, my <AHREF="..\6-98\news.html">problem with VB importing last month</A> was that my formwas from VB 3.0. So, expecting the worst, I pulled out the form I used last month.To my complete shock, it imported it! I tried another, more complex form, and itworked too. <BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;However, my ecstacy was soon lessened when I saw some of the <B>big</B>shortcomings that this importer has. For example, the lines and StaticText controlsdidn't keep their color, and the StaticText controls didn't remember their font (asimple WIN-&gt;MacOS conversion table would do, e.g. Times New Roman=Times), andtheir font size. These features wouldn't be hard to add, and I'd like to see themin a new version.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#0099FF">Spiffy New Progress Bars</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#0066FF"><BR><IMG SRC="image.gif" WIDTH="251" HEIGHT="100" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0"></FONT>&#160;&#160;&#160;Thismonth, two new progress bar controls have been released: CProgressBar, and WackyProgress Bar.

RBC strips this offto compress them, and tacks it back on to decompress them. Best of all, that 200Kis some of the worst stuff for compression with Stuffit, so you can make your applicationseven smaller. It's also available as a module, so you can make your own programsbased off its two methods: Compress and Decomprss. RBC is available at The RealbasicCaf&#233;.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#0099FF">RealBasic old version archive</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;The RealBasic Caf&#233;–the best place for RB programmers on theInternet–has started an old version archive. Last time I checked, they had versionsdating back from the aged days of CrossBasic, when everyone put an x before the nameof their program. So, if you have old versions of CrossBasic (they have all the versionsof RealBasic), be sure to upload them!</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#0099FF">String functions x2. Hong! Yah! Hah! Waah!</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;In DR1r39, there were two items in the release notes that commentedthat there were now two versions of all the string methods (len, mid, left, right,etc.) The normal ones had been modified to work in terms of characters, not bytes.The old ones that worked under the assumption that one character=one byte have gottena 'b' tacked onto the end of their names (e.g. lenb, midb).<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;What does this mean in plain english? It means that Realbasic isnow compatible with other, 16-bit alphabets, such as Japanese and Chinese. This doesn'tmean that you can start using Japanese in your programs (you'll need special systemsoftware to do this). Japanese and Chinese for example, have one letter for mostwords, whereas we has 52 letters for most words (caps and lower case). Since thereare more than 256 words in Chinese and Japanese, this means that they need to storeeach letter in a 16-bit slot as opposed to the 8-bit (one byte) spaces used for americanletters and symbols.<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;So if these modified methods are more compatible than the olderones, then why did Andrew Barry keep the old ones in? Simple. The older ones arefaster, so if you don't plan on marketing your program in the Far East, you may aswell use lenb, midb, and all their friends.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#0099FF">Now you can clutter any app you want to!!!!!</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;A new feature in F1 was the Global Process window style. This style allowsyou to make toolbars that appear in applications other than the one you includedthem in. This is useful for when you want to make a small notification window (likethe ICQ floater), or another palette for an appication. For example, you could adda favorites palette to your default browser by using the ShowURL method. This newwindow style is very cool and sometimes practical, but be warned: use these onlywhen they're neccesary, things can get ugly if you make too many of them that applyto too many applications...</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#440000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#0099FF">Version Jumps</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#0066FF"><BR></FONT>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Beginning this month, we'll have a table of all theupdates to RB in the past month.
