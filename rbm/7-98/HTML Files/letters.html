One question though, why don't you make it in DocMaker, so you could haveone file instead of the many files with HTML?<BR><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" WIDTH="100%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="50%">&#160;</TD>		<TD WIDTH="50%">- Pete Eide</TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;<FONT COLOR="#DD0000">Some of the things that I do in this magazinejust can't be done with DocMaker, like frames and multiple columns. Also, I justHATE DocMaker. So there.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF3300"></FONT></P><P>First let me say congratulations on getting our first issue out. It looks greatand I really like the popup menu at the top. Now let me clear up a few things:</P><P>1) CR1 and 1.0.0 are the same thing. CR1 means Commercial Release 1. It will have(as you already know) the VB Importer but no Java support. We will add the Java Compilerback in DR2 once we have done more work on it. DR2 should be available to registeredusers shortly after the release of CR1.</P><P>2) The problems you had with the VB Importer may have been a result of attemptingto import a non-VB5 form. We are not guaranteeing support for VB versions prior to5.0. I would appreciate it if you could try a VB5 file and then update your pagewith the results of your experience.</P><P>That said, thanks for creating what I am sure will be a monthly visit for REALbasicusers worldwide.<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;- Geoff Pearlman, REALSoftware</P><P><FONT COLOR="#66FFFF">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#DD0000">Thanksfor the note! I have part two of my VB importing adventure in the news, which wasmuch more succesful. The popup menu won't be going!</FONT></BODY></HTML>
