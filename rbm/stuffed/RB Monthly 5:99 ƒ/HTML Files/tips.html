So, this month, I feltobligated to make up for it with <B>three</B> tips—an alltime high. Enjoy!</FONT><H2>Tip #1 - Make a Help Menu</H2><P><IMG SRC="helpmenu.gif" WIDTH="281" HEIGHT="121" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0">&#160;&#160;Whenthe Apple Guide (now Help) menu made its debut in System 7.5, it wasn't used by manyapplications. However, it's caught on quite a bit since then, and many applications,like Netscape, put a whole hord of items in that menu.Wouldn't it be nice if thatcould be done in RB? Well, it can!</P><P>&#160;&#160;While creating release note summaries for DR1r4-DR1r35a (check outRBM's new collection page), I stumbled across a particularly interesting note inDR1r23 (released on 11/11/97):</P><P>&#160;&#160;* Added new NotePlayer control (see new documentation)<BR>&#160;&#160;* Added help menu support (create a menu called Help)<BR>&#160;&#160;* Added new Resource fork object for accessing resources (see new documentation)</P><P><IMG SRC="helpmenu2.gif" WIDTH="163" HEIGHT="98" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" HSPACE="5">&#160;&#160;Whilethe first and last notes seem rather funny now, the middle one is something thatmost people (including myself) didn't know about. It's fairly self-explanatory. Asthe screenshot shows, you create a menu called &quot;Help&quot;, and put variousitems in it. Then, put in any appropriate menu handlers and enablers, and your applicationhas commands in the actual Help/Apple Guide menu. Amazing!</P><P><H2>Tip #2 - Dragging code onto controls</H2><P>&#160;&#160;RB's code editor <B>definitely</B> supports drag and drop, but sodo its controls! At least pushbuttons do, anyway. In my continuing search for featuresadded in DR1 that everyone has forgotten about, I found that you can drag text fromthe code editor <B>on to a pushbutton!</B> As this nice picture shows, it's quitesimple. This feature, believe it or not, has been around since DR1r35a! Even moreoddly, it has received absolutely no attention from REAL SW since then. Therefore,it only works for pushbuttons, but it's still pretty neat, and occasionally savestime.</P><P><IMG SRC="codeclone.gif" WIDTH="461" HEIGHT="151" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P><H2>Tip #3 - Exporting Pictures</H2><P><IMG SRC="savejpeg.gif" WIDTH="157" HEIGHT="128" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0">&#160;&#160;Oneof the new features in DR2 was the ability to add pictures of any type QuickTimesuports to your project. In addition to that, a handy-dandy picture exporting functionwas added that very few people noticed: <TT>ExportPicture</TT>. It takes one parameter,a picture, and returns a boolean.</P><P>&#160;&#160;What's so special about it? Well, it handles all of the save dialogsfor you, and it lets the user export the picture in five different formats (PICT,BMP, JPEG, PhotoShop (!), and QuickTime Image). Yes, you can export PhotoShop picturesright from RB! You won't be able to use things like layers, but it's still a darnedcool feature. If the user clicks OK, the ExportPicture function will return true.Otherwise, it will return false, and you'll know that the picture hasn't been saved.</P><CENTER><P><IMG SRC="savepsd.gif" WIDTH="358" HEIGHT="258" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"><BR><FONT SIZE="2">PhotoShop from RB!?
