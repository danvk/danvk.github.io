It's much more iCab-friendly. Carryon… <TT>- Albright</TT></P><P>&#160;&#160;<B>Thanks!</B></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P>&#160;&#160;Thanks for the info about visualmacstandardbasic. At the price, Icould not afford to not check it out. Please email me when your first issue ofm VMSBMonthly comes online.<TT> - Jerry Bono</TT></P><P><B>&#160;&#160;I'll send you a letter just as SOON as it comes out. =) Apparently,VMSB's company is scared by RB, and have reduced the price to $29.95 so that we canall try it out! Yeah!!!</B></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P>&#160;&#160;Great RBM! And 7 days early... I am impressed. =) That April Foolsof yours really freaked me out though. I'll definatly be more caution when Aprilrolls around next year. ;) Also, I gotta say I really like the new format. The otherwas a little awkward, but this is stylish and functional. <TT>-David Newberry</TT></P><P><B>&#160;&#160;Sucker! I'm sure by next year, I'll have a bigger and better versionof VMSB to &quot;switch&quot; to. =)</B></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P>I read RB Monthly every month (or so..) and find it very enjoyable and helpful. I want to congratulate you on a <B>GREAT</B> April Fool's joke in your editorial..I know of and agree with your criticism of RealBASIC's bugginess and that made yourjoke <B>VERY</B> real.  Good job! <TT>- Matthew Vaughn</TT></P><P>&#160;&#160;<B>Thanks! ChipMunk Basic might have been a little too obvious, butVMSB is just good enough that there would be a slight doubt about whether or notthis was a joke...</B><TT></TT></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE><TT></TT></P><P>&#160;&#160;I'm not really an experienced programmer, but I've been trying todig into quicktime. The time scale is units per second so if the timescale is 600,a duration of  0.5 seconds would be expressed as 300. Please let me know if you haveany info that goes a little deeper than your tutorial concerning quicktime and REALbasic.Thanks. <TT>- George Tyszkiewicz</TT></P><P><B>&#160;&#160;I'll try to update that article accordingly, but we'll probablyhave a new cover on QuickTime in the near future...</B></BODY></HTML>
