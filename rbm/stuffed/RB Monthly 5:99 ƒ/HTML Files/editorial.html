I must be getting just <B>that</B> muchcloser to the perfect layout. Maybe... =)</P><P>&#160;&#160;Actually, the main change this month comes from the RBM web page.It's the addition of the compilations page. This page includes listings and compilationsof every article, every review, every tip, every quick tip, and every RB releaseever. Yes, I made one of those summary boxes that appear in the news each month forevery darned release of RB ever, from DR1r4 to 2.0.1. The Tips sections probablyhave more value, as they let you view all the tips we've ever published in one document.The RBM page itself has also received an update. The new page now has a toolbar,which allows you to browse back issues on a seperate page, and even search throughall the issues of RBM for a specific phrase.</P><P>&#160;&#160;This issue's cover is something I've had in the works for a while,but never really bothered to figure out how to do. I got my act together, and nowwe have an article on AppleScripting. I'm particularly fond of this cover, becauseit's on a subject that not many people know much about, but it doesn't require thelatest version of RB–far from it. Even people who use a DR1 version of RB will findthe cover useful.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Now that that's out of the way, I can resume my monthly bashing ofREAL SW. I can hardly wait!</P><P>&#160;&#160;The release of RB version 2.0 has been a hot topic for debate recently.RB 2.0 is certainly a more powerful product than 1.x, but the real issue is why onearth REAL SW chose to rename a DR2 release, and release a product with incompletedocumentation, incomplete database support, incomplete Windows support, and hordesof bugs.</P><P>&#160;&#160;When RB 1.0 came out almost a year ago, it was fairly well anticipated.There had been several Final Candidate releases, so a 1.0 release was inevitable.It wasn't a perfect transition (I remember being skeptical of whether that thingcalled &quot;F1&quot; was actually a copy of RB, or just a joke), but after the firstFC release, everything was fairly routine.</P><P>&#160;&#160;RB 2.0 has been quite a different story–there was absolutely no warningthat 2.0 would be released. Yes, we knew that it would arrive before April 27 (theold 30 days thing), but that limit was nowhere in sight when 2.0 actually came out.It was as if Andrew Barry finished writing up DR2r82 (which it was called for a while),and then REAL SW decided that they may as well just call this version 2.0.</P><P>&#160;&#160;As one might expect, I was quite surprised, and most people on theDR2 mailing list were as well. DR2r82 was nowhere near release quality material (justtry running it under System 7).</P><P>&#160;&#160;The other odd thing that occured with the release of 2.0 is that therewas no stop in the flow of new developer releases once &quot;2.0&quot; came out.They were called 2.0.1a1, a2, etc., but they may as well have been DRs. Just lookat the release dates in our news section, and you'll see that 2.0 came smack in themiddle of a ten day streak of daily updates. When 1.0 came out, there wasn't anotherdeveloper release of it for two months!</P><P>&#160;&#160;So if &quot;2.0&quot; was really a developer release, why was it labeledas release quality material? Like most things nowadays, I suspect money was the keyfactor. It's been a while (almost a year) since 1.0 came out, so the stream of registrationsis probably slowing down a bit. As a company, REAL SW has to make money to avoiddebt or even bankruptcy, so they took their easiest way to get in more money: makepeople buy a new version.</P><P>&#160;&#160;As long as version 2.0.1 and its followers fix most of 2.0's bugs,this strategy is fine by me–I always use DRs. However, charging $100 for an incomplete,and buggy program is hardly going to get good reviews for you. Let alone chargingan extra $200 for two even more incomplete features (databases and windows)...</P><P>&#160;&#160;Frankly, releasing 2.0 before it was ready doesn't raise huge problemsfor me. The real problem is that for most people, it will. REAL's income might jumpup for a while, but this stunt might come back to haunt them.<BR><BR>- <A HREF="mailto:dantheox@aol.com">Dan Vanderkam</A> </MULTICOL></BODY></HTML>
