Going through each and every pixel in an image with two for loopsmakes getting the desired effect easy, but getting that effect in less than a minuteis rare. The RGBsurface helped that out, but only to a certain extent.</P><P><IMG SRC="bombcolor.gif" WIDTH="222" HEIGHT="281" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0">&#160;&#160;Onesuch effect is shading a picture. To do this, you could go through each pixel, andsubtract a certain percentage from it. However, as you'd soon find out, its speedleaves something to be desired. However, S&#248;ren Olin's PictureShader changesall that.</P><P>&#160;&#160;At its heart, PictureShader is quite simple. Give a Picture and acolor to the Shade method, and you'll get a nicely shaded image back. It's simpleenough, but the most important thing is that PictureShader shades the image <B>quickly</B>.</P><P>&#160;&#160;PictureShader makes use of QuickDraw's built-in dithering abilities.Instead of changing each individual pixel in the picture, PictureShader makes a newpicture that's twice as large as the original. It then draws a horizontal line ofthe given color through every other pixel. After this, the image can be reduced againto give a shaded image. With this method, only 10 drawing commands are used on a100x20 image, as opposed to the 2,000 you'd use with the for loops.</P><P>&#160;&#160;PictureShader does more than this though. It also allows you to shadeonly specific parts of an image. Two other functions in the PictureShader moduleallow you to shade areas based on a mask color, and a mask picture. This greatlyenhances its usefulness.</P><P>&#160;&#160;However, in my tests, shading an image with another picture as a maskmade PictureShader throw up nilObjectExceptions all the time. When shading an imagewith transparency however, PictureShader worked perfectly, and preserved the maskcolor.</P><P>&#160;&#160;PictureShader is a useful class for anyone who needs to do graphicsshading. However, the inability to shade pictures to a value other than 50% is amajor setback, but not enough to keep PictureShader from being a vary worthwhileproduct.<DIV ALIGN="RIGHT"><P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="49%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#99FF99"><B>&#160;Pros:</B> Fast, Fast, Fast.
