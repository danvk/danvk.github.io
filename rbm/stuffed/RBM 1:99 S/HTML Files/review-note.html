Ifnot, then let me just tell you this: It sucks. First you have to play a note usinga numeric value. Then you have to set the velocity of the note, and to top it allof you have to stop it using a timer or a thread. Try to make a symphony with that!</P><P>&#160;&#160;The first time I tried Noteplayer, I was amazed by the fact that itwas so much easier than RB's note player, and it used Parseline, which is similiarto the &quot;Play&quot; command which is well known to anyone who programmed in GW-Basicor QBasic. Enough sobering about the old days though. Noteplayer does what it issuposed to do, no more, no less. For example, I was able to produce a nice littlegraphics keyboard with little code (But a lot of copy and pasting...).</P><P>&#160;&#160;As an extra bonus, you get a listbox class and a popup class to helpmake the selection of an instrument very, very easy. This alone is very valuablefor any one making a music program.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Let's talk about how it works. You give it a string containing thenotes to play seprated by spaces like &quot;C D E F G A&quot;, and ask it to playit. There are a few more commands for setting the tempo, pausing and that kind ofstuff. If you do not know a little about music and notes in the real world, thenyou won't get much out of Noteplayer</P><P>&#160;&#160;All in all, I rather like noteplayer. It has some nice features, andan easy way of using them. I give it a 7.5.</P><P><TT>- Review by </TT><A HREF="oliver@starmail.com"><TT>Oliver Kofoed Pederson</TT></A><TT>(Pixel)</TT><DIV ALIGN="RIGHT"><P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="49%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#99FF99"><B>&#160;Pros:</B> Gives a very easy way of playing notes.
