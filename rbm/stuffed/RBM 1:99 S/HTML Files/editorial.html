Thankfully, they now come with release notes,but still don't have an updated reference. However, this is something that I canunderstand much more easily than not bundling neccesary info that already exists.And, to make matters better, REAL SW already has a tech writer working on the updatedreference. Hooray!</P><P>&#160;&#160;Now, for my standard opinion-of-the-month™. Actually, this is a specialissue! I have TWO opinions this month!</P><P>&#160;&#160;When I purchased RB, I was rather dissapointed. When it was in itsDR1 phase, I fully expected it to be a real commercial product–box and all. Evenif it was sold only through catalogs and the realsoftware.com site, that would havebeen great. After all, Code Warrior comes in a box!</P><P>&#160;&#160;It also reflects a trend in the computer industry that I find highlyalarming–the lack of real manuals. Sure, programs come with a PDF or HTML guide,but that's a real pain. A real printed manual has no substitute, at least not inmy opinion. Sitting down in a comfortable chair and reading sections of a manualis always fun and enlightening. At least it is sometimes. But still, I can guaranteeyou, it's no fun to sit at a computer and read a PDF. That's an eye-straining, slow,and ugly read. RB should have a box. It really should.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Also, I'm beginning to develop the opinion that Andrew hates keyboardshortcuts. After all, RB has as few as is possible. Things like the &quot;New Property&quot;and &quot;New Method&quot; menu items don't have shortcuts, even though giving themones saves you TONS of time. Trust me on this one, I know. And for the ultimate example,run a program. Click on the Variables window. Cmd-W doesn't even work now!</P><P>&#160;&#160;What do I think <B>should</B>be the case for keyboard shortcuts? Ithink that everything should have a shortcut. Everything. Or, even better, therecould be a system like that in Microsoft Word (hey, 5.1 isn't bad!) where you can<B>set</B> a keyboard shortcut for anything.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Just a few thoughts.<BR>- <A HREF="mailto:dantheox@aol.com">Dan Vanderkam</A> </MULTICOL></BODY></HTML>
