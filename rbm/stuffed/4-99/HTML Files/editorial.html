I'm glad to be able to release RBM on time again (on the first of a month),and to finally run our cover story on Databases, which has been in the works sinceearly January.</P><P>&#160;&#160;I've changed the layout a tad this issue. Instead of the popupmenuon top for navigation, I've created a more standard sidebar with links. I think itlooks much nicer than the old setup, which was, dare I say, pass&#233;. This is alsobecause Internet Explorer 4.5 users were reporting problems with the JavaScript behindthe popupmenu (I don't care what Steve Jobs says–IE 4.5 has some serious problems.Not that that stops me from using it...).</P><P>&#160; And now for my stunning opinion-of-the-month™.</P><P><IMG SRC="vmsbprop.gif" WIDTH="162" HEIGHT="208" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0">&#160;&#160;Asmost of you know, I find RB to be incredibly unstable. However, there aren't anyalternatives for macs, so I've lived with this horrible stability problem for overa year. But recently, I became aware of an alternative that actually came beforeRB: Visual Mac Standard Basic (www.macstandardbasic.com).</P><P><IMG SRC="vmsbtools.gif" WIDTH="77" HEIGHT="221" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0">&#160;&#160;VMSBmay not look better than RB at first glance, but underneath that interface is a languageand functionality that's vastly superior to RB. As you can see from its toolbar tothe right, it doesn't have nearly as many controls, but it more than makes up forthat by the power of these controls. After all, what more do you really need thatnext, graphics, buttons, and timers? Sockets can be used in code, and work <B>far</B>better than RB's do. And to add to this, it has invaluable features like a Say command,which speaks text, and the ability to move sprites through a window without blankingthe screen. Ahh, if only RB had these abilities...</P><P>&#160;&#160;And don't even get me started on the bugs issue. In the month thatI've been using VMSB, it hasn't crashed a SINGLE TIME! That's unheard of in RB. Andthe tech support is great. They were prompt and had good responses to all my questions.</P><P>&#160;&#160;What are some other benefits? Well, the properties window is muchnicer. I really like those colors, and the big type makes it easy to read.</P><P>&#160;&#160;So, simply put, RB sucks. VMSB rules. End of Story. This will be thelast issue of RBM. The next issue will be VMSB Monthly. I hope everyone switchesover. They <B>won't</B> be dissappointed.</P><P>&#160;&#160;April Fools!<BR>- <A HREF="mailto:dantheox@aol.com">Dan Vanderkam</A> </MULTICOL></BODY></HTML>
