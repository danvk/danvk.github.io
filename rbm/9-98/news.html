Though it isn't very effective (it crashes on anything that isn't extremelysimple), it does work. However, you can only create 32-bit code, which means thatapplications compiled for windows always require Windows 95, 98, or NT.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#0099FF">MacAddict = RB Addict?</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;Beginning in the 26th issue of MacAddict, the CD Tour applications aremade in Realbasic. And MacAddict Magazine certainly isn't hiding this fact! Theymention it worshipfully in the &quot;The Disc&quot; section, and give a special thanksto all the Real SW staff. There's also an ad for RB on the left side of page 66 inthe magazine, on the page with the review of &quot;Kiplinger's Legal Advisor&quot;.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#0099FF">Navigation Services in RB</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;One new feature in Mac OS 8.5 (Allegro) is the revamped Open &amp; Saveboxes. Though you can't access these through commands built-in to RB, you can accessthem through an XCFN called &quot;Full Navigation&quot;. This XCFN allows you toaccess all of the six (you read right, six) types of dialogs provided by the Navigationservices.<BR>&#160;&#160;This may not be useful for long though; I've been informed by Real SWthat support for Nav Services will be built-in by the time OS 8.5 is released inOctober.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#0099FF">Anti-Aliased Text for RB</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;There's a new module available for download at the RB bbq and caf&#233;which anti-aliases text in any font, size and style onto any background. How? Ifyou've ever tried to make a smooth routine for graphis in RB, you'll realize quicklythat you can't possibly make it fast enough. So how does this module do it? Actually,the process of anti-aliasing has nothing to do with going through all the pixelsof an image. You draw the text at four times its actual size, and then shrink itdown. The resulting image uses shades of gray to make text much smoother.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#0099FF">RB Patches</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;I was always curious as to why there weren't patches that updated oneversion of RB to the next, but I never really said anything about it. Recently though,I e-mailed Geoff, and he informed me that patches would be made available soon. Whatwill this mean? No more 3 MB downloads for a few bug fixes! YES!</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#0099FF">Mozilla, here we come!</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;James Milne (who I enjoy picking on) will soon be coming out with anHTML decoder plug called &quot;MozPlug&quot;.<BR>&#160;&#160;This plugin, which is based on the recently released Netscape 4.0 sourcecode, will offer support of all the HTML tags that Netscape 4.0 supports, includingJavaScript and Frames.<BR>&#160;&#160;If it's used in conjuction with <A HREF="review-httpsocket.html">httpSocket</A>,this could make for some very powerful programs.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#0099FF">ActionSurface, now we can see thee!</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;My ActionSurface class, which used to be protected, is no longer so.This change was made because of the nature of the class. In a way, it's designedto be changed. The form it comes in should only be a basis for any games you make.<BR>&#160;&#160;In case you don't know what ActionSurface is, it's a subclass of theSpriteSurface control that is geared toward side-scrolling action games like Mario,where you are a main character, and you jump around, run into walls, etc. Essentially,you define platforms, walls, enemies, and the main character, and it takes care ofthe rest. It's available at the RB caf&#233; and BBQ.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#0099FF">OS 8 List boxes are here.</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;A new feature in DR2r8 is the &quot;HasHeader&quot; property for Listboxes.If this is checked, then the listbox will have a seperate, clickable header for eachcolumn. When clicked, the contents of the list box are sorted by that column. Itdoes leave much to be desired however. It's not the same as the ones in Mac OS 8list boxes, and instead of the &quot;reverse sort&quot; button, there's an emptysquare. Also, you can't sort numerically.</P><P><IMG SRC="headerlist.gif" WIDTH="275" HEIGHT="79" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1"></P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#0099FF">The Bar-B-Q has moved.</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;The Realbasic BBQ, a popular alternate RB server, has moved.
