You give it a message,and it makes it scroll across the canvas in a variety of styles and colors–includingshadowed.</P><P>&#160;&#160;To set it up, you create a canvas and set its super to <IMG SRC="tickertape.gif"WIDTH="296" HEIGHT="212" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" VSPACE="3">Tickertape_Class. Youthen create a timer that calls one method in it: <TT>RefreshR(false)</TT>. This scrollsthe message across the canvas at the speed defined by the timer. Though it wouldbe nice to have the canvas do all the scrolling on it's own, there's no way to integratea timer into a class without using a thread, which wouldn't make a whole lot of sensefor this class.</P><P>&#160;&#160;As you can see from the picture, you can customize the color of thebackground, text, and shadow. You can also set the direction, font, size, and style.</P><P>&#160;&#160;After you're done setting it up, the class performs fairly well. Asyou might realize, if you were to simply use the Graphics object's DrawString methodeach time, you'd have a canvas that flickered like nobody's business. The tickertapecanvas cleverly works around this by putting the entire string in a picture, andthen displaying only the neccessary parts. This makes the canvas scroll <B>much</B>faster.</P><P>&#160;&#160;However, after using this for a while, I realized something: Thisis cool, but it isn't very useful.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Think about it. How many times have you seen an application that puta side-scrolling text box to good use? They're often used for <B>vertical</B> scrollingcredits, but the only thing I can think of that scrolls horizontally is a stock ticker,which isn't the most common thing in the computer world.</P><P>&#160;&#160;As I continued to realize this, I also noticed something else: thiswouldn't be very hard to program myself.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Essentially, all that the tickertape class does is to scroll a picture–nota very difficult thing to do, even for a relatively new programmer.</P><P>&#160;&#160;In conclusion, Ian's Tickertape Canvas could be a good way to spiceup an about box, but otherwise, it's almost completely useless.<BR clear = "right"><DIV ALIGN="RIGHT"><P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="49%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#99FF99"><B>&#160;Pros:</B> Relatively simple.
