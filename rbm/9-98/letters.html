You have written:<BR><BR>if strcomp(s1, s2, 0)=0 then<BR>return true<BR>else<BR>return false<BR>end if<BR><BR>But this can be written like:<BR><BR>return strComp(s1,s1,0) = 0<BR><BR>Which would be an easier solution. This way of writing it is common in C and Pascal.<BR>You can use '&lt;' and '&gt;' in the same way; to make a function returning<BR>whether s1 is bigger that s2, use:<BR><BR>return len(s1) &gt; len(s2)<BR><BR><BR>Keep up the good RBM work, but try using some less 'strong' background<BR>clolos of the pages - else you will get a headache.<BR><BR>&#160;&#160;- Fabian Lidman</FONT></P><P>&#160;&#160;<FONT COLOR="#DD0000">I suppose that would work. Also, the backgroundcolors are slightly ligher this issue. Thanks for the tips!</FONT></BODY></HTML>
