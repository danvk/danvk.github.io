Primarily though,			it's that RB Monthly is in a different layout (in order to match with RealGurus,			which is helping to run it). And now, on to the rant...<BR><BR>&#160;&#160;More and more, when I'm at the Caf&#233;, people ask me questions out			of the blue. I'm not saying this is a bad thing–it's great to have people interested,			and I'm glad to help. What is a bad thing is the questions I'm asked, and what they			say about how much real interest in learning the language that people have.<BR><BR>&#160;&#160;When I'm helping someone, it'll either help both of us, be vaguely interesting,			or be a huge pain.<BR><BR>&#160;&#160;What I think really shows how much the person knows about RB is how much			detail I need to give them. If the person is new to RB, then they'd probably ask			me for source code only. For the others, I could just tell them what to do, and they'd			be able to convert it to source code on their own.<BR><BR>&#160;&#160;The thing that really bothers me though, is that people ask me questions			like &quot;How do I make a text file?&quot;, or &quot;What's a variable?&quot;. Some			might argue that the first question is fine, but I disagree. There are tons of pages			on the internet where you could find this out for yourself, without bothering actual			people.</TD>		<TD WIDTH="2%">			<CENTER>			<P><IMG SRC="bar.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="420" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></CENTER>		</TD>		<TD WIDTH="48%" VALIGN="TOP">&#160;&#160;However, the second question reveals a much deeper problem...<BR><BR>&#160;&#160;Many people are using Realbasic as their first programming language.			After all, it's the basic language, which is designed to be as simple as possible,			right?<BR><BR>&#160;&#160;WRONG. In reality, RB's hierarchy and many parts of its programming language			are more akin to Java than to traditional BASIC, and I don't think anyone would argue			that Java was a great first language.<BR><BR>&#160;&#160;So what's my point? Starting to program with more traditional PRINT and			INPUT versions of Basic, such as QBasic, is a very good thing to do. These languages			aren't nearly as nitpicky as RB (you can use virtually any data type in a print statement),			which lets people get a good grasp on programming in general first. Learning to type			'Print &quot;Hi&quot;' is a much better simpler an easier thing than learning to			type 'StaticText2.Text=&quot;Hi&quot;'.<BR><BR>&#160;&#160;I started this way. The first language I used was GW-BASIC. I then moved			to QBasic. Sure, I couldn't make a big application that I would try to sell people			on, but it was fun! Moving to Visual Basic was easy too, since they both can use			classes, and have similiar languages (same company). And when I switched over to			RB, it took me about 20 minutes to get good at it. You can't do this without working			with other languages, and you won't have as good an understanding of RB.<BR>			<BR>			- <A HREF="mailto:dantheox@aol.com">Dan Vanderkam</A></TD>	</TR></TABLE>In a conversation of the first sort, I could probably say something like &quot;couldn'tyou dynamically create an array of that control?&quot;, and they'd understand.
