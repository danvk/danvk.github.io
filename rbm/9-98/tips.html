For example, if themenu's keyboard shortcut was Cmd-Opt-Ctrl-Shft-Forward Delete, then that would bewritten as <IMG SRC="menucmdkey.gif" WIDTH="66" HEIGHT="11" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">.Not that anyone would ever <B>really</B> do that, but that's how it would appearif they did. Anyway, you might have though that you couldn't do things like thisin RB, because you could only write in a command key in the menu editor.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Think again. Actually, you can make a menu's command key look exactlylike that, except for the forward delete. You can add any modifier to a menu. How?Simple.</P><P>&#160;&#160;First of all, select the menu item, and click on the CommandKey property.Let's say you wanted it to be Command-Option-Shift-I. Well, to do that, you'd type&quot;Option-Shift-I&quot; in the CommandKey slot, like so:</P><P><IMG SRC="menueditor.gif" WIDTH="192" HEIGHT="45" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1"></P><P>&#160;&#160;Now, when you run your program, the menu will have the command keythat you want it to.</P><P>&#160;&#160;This method has some problems though. As you probably noticed if youtried this, the menu editor has some problems displaying these (they run past themenu). Also, you can't set these while the program is running.<H2>Tip #2 - Name your controls<IMG SRC="nameit.gif" WIDTH="198" HEIGHT="201" ALIGN="RIGHT"BORDER="0"></H2><P>&#160;&#160;Almost everybody who programs, whether it's in VB or RB usually leavesthe names of all controls as the default (i.e. Label1, StaticText1, PopupMenu1, etc.).Though it's not a horrible thing to do in Visual Basic, you're really slowing yourselfdown if you don't in Realbasic.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Why is there such a difference? RB's autocomplete feature in the codeeditor! If all your controls are a long name followed by a number, it won't guess.But if they're a three letter code followed by a name, then it can guess easily,saving you <B>tons</B> of typing. It only helps if you plan to use the controls incode though. You shouldn't bother naming a label that never changes.<BR clear = "right">&#160;&#160;&#160;Just follow this guide:</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="100%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="33%"><B>Control</B></TD>		<TD WIDTH="33%"><B>Code</B></TD>		<TD WIDTH="34%"><B>Example</B></TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="33%">PushButton</TD>		<TD WIDTH="33%">Btn</TD>		<TD WIDTH="34%">BtnCancel</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="33%">RadioButton</TD>		<TD WIDTH="33%">Opt</TD>		<TD WIDTH="34%">OptDoubleSpaced</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="33%">Checkbox</TD>		<TD WIDTH="33%">Chk</TD>		<TD WIDTH="34%">ChkDontAsk</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="33%">StaticText</TD>		<TD WIDTH="33%">Lbl</TD>		<TD WIDTH="34%">LblAmountTransfered</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="33%">PopupMenu</TD>		<TD WIDTH="33%">Pop</TD>		<TD WIDTH="34%">PopSize</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="33%">Timer</TD>		<TD WIDTH="33%">Tmr</TD>		<TD WIDTH="34%">TmrTicker</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="33%">TabPanel</TD>		<TD WIDTH="33%">Tab</TD>		<TD WIDTH="34%">TabOptions</TD>	</TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
