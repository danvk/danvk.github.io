The organization they provide in	a small project isn't worth it.</FONT>	<LI>&#160;&#160;<FONT SIZE="4">Always save after dragging a file into the project	window or using the File Types dialog. These are known to cause crashes when you	run the program on some machines.</FONT>	<LI><FONT SIZE="4">&#160;&#160;Don't use Select Case with strings. It still uses	the old style &quot;=&quot; comparisons, which are about 150 times slower than the	comparisons used in if statements. Select Case works fine with numbers though...</FONT>	<LI><FONT SIZE="4">&#160;&#160;Always remember to setup default and cancel buttons	for dialog boxes. This makes them much more efficient for the user to work with.</FONT>	<LI><FONT SIZE="4">&#160;&#160;If you're getting NilObjectExceptions when you try	to edit/access graphics, set up an If statement around the code to see if the picture	you're accessing is nil.</FONT>	<LI><FONT SIZE="4">&#160;&#160;Always keep a pencil and a stack of paper with you	when you're writing a program. Sometimes, you've just got to write something out	to see how it works. And as a bonus, paper isn't susceptible to system crashes!</FONT>	<LI><FONT SIZE="4">&#160;&#160;If you get NilObjectExceptions from a graphics object,	even though the picture containing it isn't nil, it's probably because the picture	is from the clipboard, or the project window. These pictures exist, but don't have	graphics. To edit them, make a new picture, and draw the old picture into it.</FONT>	<LI><FONT SIZE="4">&#160;&#160;Instead of writing Open and New code, use App.NewDocument,	and App.OpenDocument.</FONT>	<LI><FONT SIZE="4">&#160;&#160;With doubles, use Format, not Str for better precision.</FONT>	<LI>&#160;&#160;Make your own edit menu	<LI><B>Creating an EditField that doesn't wrap text</B>	<LI>Hold down shift while you resize a control.	<LI>ClearFocus method</UL></BODY></HTML>
