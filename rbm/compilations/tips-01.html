However, as everyone knows,you can add them with ResEdit. Doing it is simple.</P><P><B>Method 1-A resource editor<BR>&#160;&#160;</B>Just open up Realbasic in ResEdit or the far superior Resourcer,and open the Edit MENU resource. Then, add the shortcuts Cmd-Opt-V (V=Variable),and Cmd-Opt-M. They will appear as an accent and a check mark, but that's OK. Theystill work. The only problem with this is that every time you get a new version ofRB, you have to do this again.</P><P><B>Method 2-A macro utility</B><BR>&#160;&#160;This is a better method because you don't have to modify RB every singletime you download it. Any macro utility will do for this, though I personally thinkthat OneClick leaves everything else in the dust. Simply make two new macros thatchoose the two menu items, and assign them shortcuts. Since the Realbasic applicationis always called &quot;REALBasic&quot;, you won't have to create these again everytime you get a new version.</P><P><B>Method 3-Write mail to </B><A HREF="mailto:geoff@realbasic.com"><B>geoff@realbasic.com</B></A><B><BR></B>&#160;&#160;Using this method, everyone writes mail to geoff@realbasic.com, andrequests that he include shortcuts built in.</P><P><FONT SIZE="5"><B>Tip #<A NAME="2"></A>2</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="4"><B> </B></FONT><FONTSIZE="5"><B>- Save before you run macro</B></FONT></P><P>&#160;&#160;Realbasic crashes a lot. A heck of a lot. More than any other appI've ever used. And it crashes in such interesting ways…<BR>&#160;&#160;Anyway, the point of this is that since it crashes a lot, you shouldsave your work a lot. The problem with this is that it seems that just before itcrashes, the save command stops working (Arggh...). What seems to work for me issimply holding down Command and S. This saves it many times, and almost entirelyensures that it works. Once again, OneClick or another utility can simplify thiswhole thing. In OneClick, just use this script:<BR><BR><TT>Repeat 10<BR>&#160;&#160;SelectMenu &quot;File&quot;, &quot;Save&quot;<BR>End Repeat<BR>SelectMenu &quot;Debug&quot;, &quot;Run&quot;</TT><BR><BR>If you assign this to be Cmd-R, then it will do it whenever you use the keyboardshortcut to run. This is a big time saver.</P><P><FONT SIZE="5"><B>Tip #<A NAME="3"></A>3 - How to use the Scroll Method</B></FONT></P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="100%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="274">&#160;One of the more interesting changes in r36 was the addition of a Canvas.Scroll			method. Here's the syntax:<TT><BR>			<BR>			&#160;&#160;Scroll(deltaX as integer, deltaY as integer, left as integer, top as			integer, width as integer, height as integer, scrollControls as Boolean) </TT><BR>			<BR>			&#160;&#160;This method allows you to a canvas to scroll easily. Essentially, what			it does is to change the coordinates for the Canvas, i.e. the top left is -10, 5			instead of 0,0. More interesting than this is the <TT>scrollControls</TT> property.			The reference says that this determines whether or not controls on top of the canvas			scroll as well. To try this out, I whipped up a simple project that used the scroll			method. Screenshots can be found to your right.<BR>			<BR>			&#160;&#160;The code for the scroll button at the right is this:<BR>			<BR>			<TT>Canvas1.Scroll 100, 0</TT><BR>			<BR>			&#160;&#160;This one line hides all five controls over the canvas just as effectively			as uses five <TT>Control.Visible=False</TT> statements. If you had tried this with			a group box, it wouldn't have worked. This is an excellent way to group and move			controls, and it is also a good way to manipulate graphics.</TD>		<TD WIDTH="175"><IMG SRC="../7-98/Scroll1.gif" WIDTH="174" HEIGHT="103" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"><BR>			<BR>			<IMG SRC="../7-98/Scroll2.gif" WIDTH="174" HEIGHT="103" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"><BR>			<B><I>Before and After</I>.</B><FONT SIZE="2"> The controls haven't been hidden,			they've just been scrolled off the right edge of the canvas that they're on. This			would've taken five lines of code normally, but with scroll, it's only one.</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE></P><P><FONT SIZE="5"><B>Tip #<A NAME="4"></A>4</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="4"><B> - </B></FONT><FONTSIZE="5"><B>Don't restart, Interrupt!</B></FONT></P><P>&#160;&#160;One of the nastiest things about RB is how much it crashes, especiallywith &quot;Type 10&quot; errors. It displays a black and white box that lets yourestart. However, if you can still move the mouse, then there is hope!!! Simply pressCommand-Power (not Cmd-Ctrl-Power) to go into Interrupt mode (if you have MacBugsinstalled, then you'll drop to that). A new window will come up with a greater thansign. Simply type &quot;G FINDER&quot; to go back to the finder and quit RB withoutrestarting the whole computer. If it works, then save the rest of the stuff you haveopen before opening RB again. This trick works for apps besides RB too.</P><P><FONT SIZE="5"><B>Tip #<A NAME="5"></A>5</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="4"><B> - </B></FONT><FONTSIZE="5"><B>Use Confirm, and InputBox classes</B></FONT></P><P>&#160;&#160;&#160;RealBasic does have a MsgBox method, but it lacks some otherfeatures that Visual Basic has built-in: A confirm function (This is integrated intothe MsgBox function in VB), and an InputBox function. Fortunately, with RB's greatclass system, it's easy to make these on your own. Simply make two windows: One fora confirm box (w/ a yes and no button), and one for an input box.</P><P>&#160;&#160;&#160;I could explain how to do this further, but I've decided tospare you the boredom. If you downloaded this issue as a StuffIt archive, then youalready have these classes (in the Confirm and InputBox) folder.

He also pointed out that by using the strcomp function, you could speed theseup several hundred times. Here's how it works…<BR><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="100%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="50%">First of all, you need to learn what the StrComp function does. As its name implies,			it compares two strings. The value it returns tells you if the two strings are the			same, or if they're not, it tells you which one comes before the other in alphabetical			order. The handy table to the right may simplify things some.</TD>		<TD WIDTH="2%"><HR WIDTH="1" SIZE="100" NOSHADE>		</TD>		<TD WIDTH="48%">			<TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="100%">				<TR>					<TD WIDTH="13%"><B>s1</B></TD>					<TD WIDTH="14%"><B>s2</B></TD>					<TD WIDTH="73%"><B>StrComp(s1, s2, 0)</B></TD>				</TR>				<TR>					<TD WIDTH="13%">a</TD>					<TD WIDTH="14%">z</TD>					<TD WIDTH="73%">&#160;&#160;-1</TD>				</TR>				<TR>					<TD WIDTH="13%">z</TD>					<TD WIDTH="14%">a</TD>					<TD WIDTH="73%">&#160;&#160;+1</TD>				</TR>				<TR>					<TD WIDTH="13%">A</TD>					<TD WIDTH="14%">a</TD>					<TD WIDTH="73%">&#160;&#160;-1</TD>				</TR>				<TR>					<TD WIDTH="13%">A</TD>					<TD WIDTH="14%">A</TD>					<TD WIDTH="73%">&#160;&#160;0</TD>				</TR>			</TABLE>		</TD>	</TR></TABLE><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><BR></FONT>&#160;As you can see from the helpful table, if the two stringsare the same,it returns 0. So, the statement<BR><TT>If s1=s2 then</TT><BR>&#160;&#160;is the same as<BR><TT>If StrComp(s1, s2, 0)=0 then</TT><BR><BR>&#160;&#160;The strComp example may look longer and more complicated, but in reality,it's a LOT faster.<BR><BR>&#160;&#160;If you don't want to get stuck typing StrComp for the rest of your life,there IS a better solution. Just create a new method called &quot;Equal&quot; thattakes two strings as a parameter, and returns a boolean. Here's the code for it:<BR><BR><TT>Function Equal(s1 as string, s2 as string) as boolean<BR>if strcomp(s1, s2, 0)=0 then<BR>return true<BR>else<BR>return false<BR>end if<BR>End Function</TT><BR><BR>&#160;&#160;After you type in that function, you can use the format &quot;If Equal(s1,s2) then&quot;, which makes much more sense, and looks nicer. If you want to testto see if two strings AREN'T equal, just replace that statement with &quot;If NotEqual(s1, s2) then&quot;.<BR><BR>Speeding up your program couldn't be easier!<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="5"><B>Tip #<A NAME="7"></A>7&#160;—&#160;Declare items the quick way</B></FONT></P><P>&#160;&#160;In case you didn't already realize it, declaring variables used tobe a nightmare. First of all, you had to put them all on different lines, and theyall had to have an &quot;as type&quot; clause after them. This made for some icky,and <B>very</B> long code.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Things eventually got better though. You can now declare multiplevariables on one line. However, there's still oen more trick that not many peopleknow about...<BR><BR>&#160;If you want to declare two or more variables of the same type, you can omitthe &quot;as type&quot; part. For example, <TT>dim s as string, t as string</TT>&#160;couldbe rewritten as <TT>dim s, t as string</TT>. This is a very useful shortcut, especiallywhen there are many variables of the same type.</P><P>&#160;So, if you still aren't convinced, look at these three snapshots:</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="100%">	<TR>		<TD><B>Really old</B></TD>		<TD><TT>Dim m as folderitem<BR>			Dim n as folderitem<BR>			Dim o as folderitem<BR>			Dim p as folderitem</TT></TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD><B>Current</B></TD>		<TD><TT>Dim m as folderitem, n as folderitem<BR>			Dim o as folderitem, p as folderitem</TT></TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD><B>The Secret Way&#160;</B></TD>		<TD><TT>Dim m, n, o, p as folderitem</TT></TD>	</TR></TABLE></P><P>&#160;&#160;As you can see from that lovely diagram, it's the biggest clarityimproving declaration change you can make. It also saves a bunch of typing, and youwon't have to scroll to see everything. So, be sure to use this trick whenever youcan!!!</P><H2>Tip #<A NAME="8"></A>8 - You can use special modifiers</H2><P>&#160;&#160;If you've worked with menus for any amount of time, you know thatthere are special modifier symbols for keys other than command. For example, if themenu's keyboard shortcut was Cmd-Opt-Ctrl-Shft-Forward Delete, then that would bewritten as <IMG SRC="../9-98/menucmdkey.gif" WIDTH="66" HEIGHT="11" ALIGN="BOTTOM"BORDER="0">. Not that anyone would ever <B>really</B> do that, but that's how itwould appear if they did. Anyway, you might have though that you couldn't do thingslike this in RB, because you could only write in a command key in the menu editor.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Think again. Actually, you can make a menu's command key look exactlylike that, except for the forward delete. You can add any modifier to a menu. How?Simple.</P><P>&#160;&#160;First of all, select the menu item, and click on the CommandKey property.Let's say you wanted it to be Command-Option-Shift-I. Well, to do that, you'd type&quot;Option-Shift-I&quot; in the CommandKey slot, like so:</P><P><IMG SRC="../9-98/menueditor.gif" WIDTH="192" HEIGHT="45" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1"></P><P>&#160;&#160;Now, when you run your program, the menu will have the command keythat you want it to.</P><P>&#160;&#160;This method has some problems though. As you probably noticed if youtried this, the menu editor has some problems displaying these (they run past themenu). Also, you can't set these while the program is running.<H2>Tip #<A NAME="9"></A>9 - Name your controls<IMG SRC="../9-98/nameit.gif" WIDTH="198"HEIGHT="201" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0"></H2><P>&#160;&#160;Almost everybody who programs, whether it's in VB or RB usually leavesthe names of all controls as the default (i.e. Label1, StaticText1, PopupMenu1, etc.).Though it's not a horrible thing to do in Visual Basic, you're really slowing yourselfdown if you don't in Realbasic.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Why is there such a difference? RB's autocomplete feature in the codeeditor! If all your controls are a long name followed by a number, it won't guess.But if they're a three letter code followed by a name, then it can guess easily,saving you <B>tons</B> of typing. It only helps if you plan to use the controls incode though. You shouldn't bother naming a label that never changes.<BR clear = "right"> &#160;&#160;&#160;Just follow this guide:</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="100%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="33%"><B>Control</B></TD>		<TD WIDTH="33%"><B>Code</B></TD>		<TD WIDTH="34%"><B>Example</B></TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="33%">PushButton</TD>		<TD WIDTH="33%">Btn</TD>		<TD WIDTH="34%">BtnCancel</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="33%">RadioButton</TD>		<TD WIDTH="33%">Opt</TD>		<TD WIDTH="34%">OptDoubleSpaced</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="33%">Checkbox</TD>		<TD WIDTH="33%">Chk</TD>		<TD WIDTH="34%">ChkDontAsk</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="33%">StaticText</TD>		<TD WIDTH="33%">Lbl</TD>		<TD WIDTH="34%">LblAmountTransfered</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="33%">PopupMenu</TD>		<TD WIDTH="33%">Pop</TD>		<TD WIDTH="34%">PopSize</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="33%">Timer</TD>		<TD WIDTH="33%">Tmr</TD>		<TD WIDTH="34%">TmrTicker</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="33%">TabPanel</TD>		<TD WIDTH="33%">Tab</TD>		<TD WIDTH="34%">TabOptions</TD>	</TR></TABLE><H2>Tip #<A NAME="10"></A>10 - Close the toolbars</H2><P>&#160;&#160;In general, you'll never use the color palette (though it <B>is</B>super-nifty), and you'll only use the Tools and Properties toolbars when you're layingout an interface. When you're writing code, these windows are pointless. However,much to my dismay, many people simply never close these windows!</P><P>&#160;&#160;So, the tip is to keep these windows closed whenever you're <B>not</B>doing layout. You'll get a lot more screen space, and RB will run faster (the propertiespalette takes a long time to refresh).</P><P>&#160;&#160;To be even MORE super-effecient with your workspace, make a macrothat closes and opens all the toolbars with a single keystroke. <FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#DD0000"><I>&lt;InDR2, all of these have shortcuts, and close automatically in the code editor. However,the close all keystroke is still a huge timesaver&gt;</I></FONT><H2>Tip #<A NAME="11"></A>11 - Beautify your code</H2><P>&#160;&#160;Many, many people give all their variables names that are entirelylowercase, such as &quot;sout, temp, i&quot;, and so on. Many more people don't leaveblank space in their code, and put comments at the end of lines without aligningthem. This is downright ugly!</P><P>&#160;&#160;So, when you're writing code, capitalize letters in variables thatare the start of words. For example, if the variable <TT>binval</TT> is a binaryvalue, name it <TT>BinVal</TT>. This just looks better.</P><P>&#160;&#160;And be sure to put in blank lines at points where the code is brokeninto sections. This makes it much clearer, and easier to read. Take these examples...</P><P><B>The bad</B></P><P><IMG SRC="../10-98/badcode.gif" WIDTH="421" HEIGHT="247" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P><P>&#160;&#160;All the declarations are on a long line, and are all in lower case.There isn't any blank space, and the comments are randomly strewn about the line.</P><P><B>The good</B></P><P><IMG SRC="../10-98/goodcode.gif" WIDTH="421" HEIGHT="247" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P><P>&#160;&#160;The variables are logically grouped, and have the correct case. Thereis blank space seperating the groups of code. The comments are lined up, and lookvery nice.This makes going back and editing it later much easier, and it makes iteasier for others to read as well.</P><P><FONT SIZE="5"><B>Tip #<A NAME="12"></A>12—Use Control Binding</B></FONT></P><P>&#160;&#160;One of the coolest new features of the DR2 releases has been controlbinding. This feature, which is available in DR2r24 and up, has been simplifyingmy life quite a bit, and it should simplify your's too!</P><P>&#160;&#160;The idea behind control binding is that in many programs, clickingon a button, or selecting an item in a list affects the appearance of another control.For example, clicking the a button might start playing a movie, and clicking stopmight (logically enough), stop it.</P><P><IMG SRC="../12-98/moviewin1.gif" WIDTH="135" HEIGHT="181" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0">&#160;&#160;Normally,this would involve writing some code—a whopping one line for each button. However,as lazy developers, this is simply too much! Control binding aims to simplify thisoh-so-complex process.</P><P>&#160;&#160;First off, we'll need to create three controls: One MoviePlayer, andtwo PushButtons, so that your project looks something like the picture to the left.</P><P>&#160;&#160;This setup is fairly simple. If you've had any experience with themovieplayer control, then you probably know how you could implement this. Open thecode editor, and put <TT>MoviePlayer1.Start</TT> in the Start button's Action event,and <TT>MoviePlayer1.Stop</TT> in the Stop button's Action event. However, I havea far more interesting way of doing this: one that doesn't even involve opening thecode editor!</P><P>&#160;&#160;First off, select the Start button. Next, hold down the Command andShift keys, and drag it onto the MoviePlayer control. A line will appear, and themovieplayer will be hilighted with a blue border. Let go of the mouse button. Thisdialog will (hopefully) appear:</P><P><IMG SRC="../12-98/image23.gif" WIDTH="413" HEIGHT="234" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P><P><IMG SRC="../12-98/image24.gif" WIDTH="135" HEIGHT="181" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0">&#160;&#160;Sincewe want the first button to play the movie, select the first option in the list.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Next, do the exact same things for the stop button, except make it<B>stop</B> the movie. When you choose OK, your window should like like the pictureto the right. If you drag a movie into the project, and set the movieplayer's Movieproperty (in the properties window) to that movie, then you've got a complete project.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Simple, huh? And you didn't need to type a single line of code!</P><P>&#160;&#160;Personally, I think this is an extremely exciting addition. As moreand more bindings are made possible, this feature will become more and more useful.Not only will it make life easier for beginners (at that point, the less code, thebetter), but it'll make life much simpler for everyone. Now if there were only away to delete a binding...<BR clear = "right"></P><P><FONT SIZE="5"><B>Tip #<A NAME="13"></A>13—Use Constants</B></FONT></P><P>&#160;&#160;A great new feature that many people have been asking for has finallyarrived: Constants. Constants are normally variables with a preset value. For example,in Visual Basic, you'd define a constant by typing in <TT>Global Const PI=3.14159</TT>.This would add a variable called PI that could be accessed from anywhere.</P><P>&#160;&#160;RB's version of this feature is more complicated, but much more powerful.In this example, I'll show you how to use it to set the value of PI based on thetype of computer that the program is being run on. For Macs and Java machines, PIwill be 3.14159 (the right number). For Windows, the value will be 3.14112. (Muchthanks to the mailing list for this devious idea!)</P><P>&#160;&#160;First of all, we'll want to make a module. Constants can only existin modules, even though there's a &quot;constants&quot; section in classes too.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Open up the module, and choose &quot;New Constant...&quot; from theEdit menu. You should see a screen that looks something like this:</P><P><IMG SRC="../12-98/constantwin1.gif" WIDTH="453" HEIGHT="324" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P><P>&#160;&#160;As you can see, it's <B>much</B> more complicated than simply typinga value for a variable!</P><P>&#160;&#160;First of all, type in &quot;PI&quot; in the name field. In the valuefield, type 3.14159. You must give constants a value, or RB won't recognize them.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Now comes the fun part! Click the &quot;Add...&quot; button in thelower left corner. The following dialog will appear:</P><P><IMG SRC="../12-98/addconstwin.gif" WIDTH="293" HEIGHT="174" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P><P>&#160;&#160;From the platform menu, select &quot;Macintosh&quot;. Then, type in3.14159 in the Value field. Finally, click OK to add the type. You'll want to dothis for Java too.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Finally, add another constant, and select Windows from the platformmenu. In the Value field, type 3.14112. Click OK. Your Constants window should looklike this:</P><P><IMG SRC="../12-98/constantwin2.gif" WIDTH="453" HEIGHT="324" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P><P>&#160;&#160;After you click OK, your constant has been added. From now on, youcan use it like a normal variable with the name PI throughout your code. However,there's also a special way to use constants. On a PushButton, make the caption anumber sign (#) followed by the constant's name. The button caption will automaticallybecome whatever value that constant is!<H2>Tip #<A NAME="14"></A>14 - Never underestimate the Canvas control</H2><P>&#160;&#160;In general, if someone needs a type of control that isn't available,they go running to a plugin developer, or complain to Andrew (the author of RB).This is very, very baaaadddd...</P><P>&#160;&#160;What's the right thing to do? In general, <B>any</B> interface controlcan be rewritten as a subclass of the canvas! Already, people have made chart, table,listbox, tabpanel, painting, vector-editing, and HTML displaying subclasses of acanvas.</P><P>&#160;&#160;And as an added bonus, if you make it yourself, then you'll just feelbetter about it.<H2>Tip #<A NAME="15"></A>15 - Use Method <I>Overloading</I></H2><P>&#160;&#160;Yes, yes, you're probably saying &quot;OverLOADING&quot;? What isthis guy talking about!? However, if you have one of the newer DR2 releases, youcan create multiple versions of a method with the same name that take different parameters.For example, you could create a routine like this:</P><P><IMG SRC="../1-99/image20.gif" WIDTH="402" HEIGHT="111" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P><P>And then, make another routine like this:</P><P><IMG SRC="../1-99/image21.gif" WIDTH="402" HEIGHT="117" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P><P>&#160;&#160;Now, both <TT>Message &quot;Hello&quot; and Message 100</TT> are validstatements. You can also make routines with different numbers of parameters thatare in different orders, and that sort of thing too. Nifty, huh?<H2>Tip #<A NAME="16"></A>16 - Use ByRef Parameters</H2><P>&#160;&#160;In DR2r37, a great new feature was added: the ByVal and ByRef keywords.These keywords, whcih will be familiar to any VB user, allow you to control how aparameter is passed to a method. Usually, this method would give you an error sayingthat it's &quot;expecting an lvalue&quot;:</P><P><TT>Sub DoSomething(s as string)<BR>&#160;&#160;s=&quot;Hello!&quot;<BR>End Sub</TT></P><P>&#160;&#160;It gives you this error because you're not allowed to directly modifya parameter. This is because they're passed by their value. RB has no idea whichvariable s actually represents; it just knows its value. However, if we change theroutine to this:</P><P><TT>Sub DoSomething(ByRef s as string)<BR>&#160;&#160;s=&quot;Hello!&quot;<BR>End Sub</TT></P><P>&#160;&#160;Then we don't get an error! S is now passed to DoSomething as a variable,not a value (specifically, it's passed BY REFerence, thus ByRef). This means thatwe can treat it like any normal variable, including changing its value.</P><P>&#160;&#160;ByVal is still the default, but ByRef is a welcome feature.<H2>Tip #<A NAME="17"></A>17 - Radio Buttons w/o frames</H2><P>&#160;&#160;If you've ever worked with the RadioButton control, you know thatit's a major pain. Only one can be selected at once, unless you add ugly lookingframes to your window, like so:</P><P><IMG SRC="../2-99/image22.gif" WIDTH="274" HEIGHT="222" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P><P>&#160;&#160;However, this grouping system also works if the frames are invisible(sort of like tab panels–see &quot;Tabs, but no panels&quot;). So, if we make bothof the frames invisible, we could make a nicer interface–like this:</P><P><IMG SRC="../2-99/image23.gif" WIDTH="274" HEIGHT="222" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P><P>&#160;&#160;Sure, your window may look ugly in the editor, but the finished workis much nicer, and that's all that really matters.</P><P><FONT SIZE="5"><B>Tip #<A NAME="18"></A>18&#160;—&#160;Flicker-free editfields</B></FONT></P><P>&#160;&#160;If you've ever made a program where text is constantly being addedto a text field (like in a chat program), you'll know just how much Edit fields flicker.You may have thought it was unavoidable, but there is a trick!<BR>&#160;&#160;Normally, to append something to an edit field, you'd use something likethis:</P><P>&#160;<TT>TxtChat.Text = TxtChat.Text + &quot;Dan Vanderkam: RB Monthly rules!&quot;</TT><BR><BR>&#160;&#160;However, this would make the edit field flicker, especially if therewas more info above what was being added. There is a trick though. This is the codefor it:</P><P>&#160;<TT>TxtChat.SelStart = Len(TxtChat.Text)<BR>&#160;TxtChat.SelText = &quot;Dan Vanderkam: RB Monthly rules!&quot;</TT></P><P>&#160;&#160;This method, believe it or not, guarantees that almost NO flickeringtakes place. And, as an added bonus, it scrolls down to the end of the text. Here'swhat it does:</P><P>&#160;&#160;1) The first line moves the insertion point to the end (which is givenby the len function).<BR>&#160;&#160;2) The second line adds the text at the insertion point.</P><P>&#160;&#160;So, it's two easy steps to flicker-free text. (Hey! That rhymes!)</P><P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<FONTSIZE="2">Thanks to Ian L. for this one!</FONT></P><H2>Tip <A NAME="19"></A>#19 - Make a Help Menu</H2><P><IMG SRC="../5-99/helpmenu.gif" WIDTH="281" HEIGHT="121" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0">&#160;&#160;Whenthe Apple Guide (now Help) menu made its debut in System 7.5, it wasn't used by manyapplications.

Well, it can!</P><P>&#160;&#160;While creating release note summaries for DR1r4-DR1r35a (check outRBM's new compilation page), I stumbled across a particularly interesting note inDR1r23 (released on 11/11/97):</P><P>&#160;&#160;* Added new NotePlayer control (see new documentation)<BR>&#160;&#160;* Added help menu support (create a menu called Help)<BR>&#160;&#160;* Added new Resource fork object for accessing resources (see new documentation)</P><P><IMG SRC="../5-99/helpmenu2.gif" WIDTH="163" HEIGHT="98" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0"HSPACE="5">&#160;&#160;While the first and last notes seem rather funny now, themiddle one is something that most people (including myself) didn't know about. It'sfairly self-explanatory. As the screenshot shows, you create a menu called &quot;Help&quot;,and put various items in it. Then, put in any appropriate menu handlers and enablers,and your application has commands in the actual Help/Apple Guide menu. Amazing!</P><P><H2>Tip #<A NAME="20"></A>20 - Dragging code onto controls</H2><P>&#160;&#160;RB's code editor <B>definitely</B> supports drag and drop, but sodo its controls! At least pushbuttons do, anyway. In my continuing search for featuresadded in DR1 that everyone has forgotten about, I found that you can drag text fromthe code editor <B>on to a pushbutton!</B> As this nice picture shows, it's quitesimple. This feature, believe it or not, has been around since DR1r35a! Even moreoddly, it has received absolutely no attention from REAL SW since then. Therefore,it only works for pushbuttons, but it's still pretty neat, and occasionally savestime.</P><P><IMG SRC="../5-99/codeclone.gif" WIDTH="461" HEIGHT="151" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P><H2>Tip #<A NAME="21"></A>21 - Write multiple lines in the IDE</H2><P>&#160;&#160;<FONT SIZE="4">&#160;As I mentioned in the news this month, DR2r70sported a new button next to every string property that lets you type in a valuein a dialog identical to the &quot;Edit List&quot; one.

Now if only that worked for control subclasses…</P><H2>Tip #25 - Draw a window</H2><P><B>&#160;&#160;</B>In 2.x, every window sports a new method: DrawInto. This methodtakes three parameters: a graphics object, and an x and y coordinate. Using it, youcan draw the content of the window into a graphics object.</P><H2>Tip #26 - Use Graphics Exporting</H2><P>&#160;&#160;A new feature in 2.1 is the QTGraphicsExporter class. Using this,you can easily save a picture object into a file using a variety of formats. Andunlike the ExportPicture function, they don't require you to show a save dialog (thoughyou can). To create a graphics exporter, use the GetQTGraphicsExporter function.It takes a four letter string which corresponds to the type code of the file thatyou want to save. For example, PICT is for PICT, JPEG is for JPEG, and so on. Afterthis, you can use the rest of the class's methods to manipulate the image, and eventuallysave it:</P><UL>	<LI><TT>HasSettingsDialog As Boolean</TT> - True if a settings dialog exists for	the file format.	<LI><TT>RequestSettings As Boolean</TT> - When this method is called, the settings	dialog for the image type is shown. Returns true if the user clicks OK, false if	they click Cancel.	<LI><TT>DefaultExtension As String</TT> - The default extension for the file format	(ie, &quot;.jpg&quot;)	<LI><TT>DesiredTargetDataSize As Integer</TT> - The size of the file when it's saved.	<LI><TT>CompressionQuality As Integer</TT> - How much to compress the image.	<LI><TT>OutputFileType As String</TT> - Four letter type code of the file.	<LI><TT>OutputFileCreator As String</TT> - Four letter creator code of the file.	<LI><TT>SavePicture(location As Folder, image As Picture) As Boolean</TT> - Saves	the picture to location.

To spruce them up, many programsput a placard at the back of the window to give it a beveled look. This is easy enoughto do in RB (see the screenshot), and it'll really improve the look of the window.</P><P>&#160;&#160;There is one problem though: it may not seem possible to select thewindow itself (after all, there isn't any space that doesn't have a control). Fearnot though, simply click on a control, and then shift-click to deselect it. The windowis now editable from the properties window.</P><H2>Tip #28 - Use LockLeft, LockRight, etc.</H2><P>&#160;&#160;Making a window resize correctly is a pain.You have to manually writecode in the resize event to move and change the size of each control. Right? Nope!All controls have four properties that will help you: LockLeft, LockRight, LockTop,and LockBottom. How do they work? Pretty simple. This diagram should help. Left isLockLeft, Right is LockRight, and so on. Bot stands for Bottom and Rgt stands forright.</P><P><IMG SRC="../6-99/lock.gif" WIDTH="368" HEIGHT="239" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P><P>&#160;&#160;If we set the Lock properties as this window instructs us, all thebuttons will resize on their own.</P><P>&#160;&#160;What do the values stand for? They LOCK the distance from the edgethat you specify. For example, the bottom right button will always be the exact samedistance from the bottom edge and the right edge if its LockRight and LockBottomproperties are checked. What if LockTop and LockBottom are both checked? The controlwill resize, just like the controls that aren't on corners do in this window. Thisshould save you a LOT of code, but if you stlill need to use the Resize event, rememberthat controls with Lock properties checked are resized before Resized is fired.</P><P><FONT SIZE="2"><BR></FONT><FONT SIZE="4"><B>Go To Tip: </B></FONT><A HREF="#1"><FONT SIZE="4">1</FONT></A><FONTSIZE="4"> </FONT><A HREF="#2"><FONT SIZE="4">2</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="4"> </FONT><AHREF="#3"><FONT SIZE="4">3</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="4"> </FONT><A HREF="#4"><FONT SIZE="4">4</FONT></A><FONTSIZE="4"> </FONT><A HREF="#5"><FONT SIZE="4">5</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="4"> </FONT><AHREF="$6"><FONT SIZE="4">6</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="4"> </FONT><A HREF="#7"><FONT SIZE="4">7</FONT></A><FONTSIZE="4"> </FONT><A HREF="#8"><FONT SIZE="4">8</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="4"> </FONT><AHREF="#9"><FONT SIZE="4">9</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="4"> </FONT><A HREF="#10"><FONT SIZE="4">10</FONT></A><FONTSIZE="4"> </FONT><A HREF="#11"><FONT SIZE="4">11</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="4"> </FONT><AHREF="#12"><FONT SIZE="4">12</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="4"> </FONT><A HREF="#13"><FONTSIZE="4">13</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="4"> </FONT><A HREF="#14"><FONT SIZE="4">14</FONT></A><FONTSIZE="4"> </FONT><A HREF="#15"><FONT SIZE="4">15</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="4"> </FONT><AHREF="#16"><FONT SIZE="4">16</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="4"> </FONT><A HREF="#17"><FONTSIZE="4">17</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="4"> </FONT><A HREF="#18"><FONT SIZE="4">18</FONT></A><FONTSIZE="4"> </FONT><A HREF="#19"><FONT SIZE="4">19</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="4"> </FONT><AHREF="#20"><FONT SIZE="4">20</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="4"> </FONT><A HREF="#21"><FONTSIZE="4">21</FONT></A></BODY></HTML>
