Plugins are files that add more abilities to REALBasic. So far, I have onlyfound two complete Plugins which add useful features to Realbasic. These are theMADPlug, by James Milne, which allows Realbasic to play music from a variety of formats,like MAD and MOD. The other, QuickDrawLib, which is not free, allows you to accessQuickDraw, which lets you draw to graphics objects quicker, and in more ways.</P><P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first plugin I downloaded was MADPlug, and it mademe think that RB plugs were just like VBXs (Visual Basic Extensions) or OCXs (ActiveX;don't ask, after all, microsoft made the acronym...) However, upon closer inspection,I realized that they are much different. Whereas VBXs and OCXs add actual controls,RB Plug-ins can do just about anything. The two plug-ins that are available now showthis. MADPlug is like a normal control that you can drop onto a window, and use.QuickDrawLib however, isn't a control. It adds new functions and Graphics objectmethods. This is something that VBXs and OCXs can't do.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="100%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="47%" ROWSPAN="3">As the table at the right proves, plugins are better that VBXs and OCXs. However,			this statement is not entirely true. As of now, there are two RB Plugins, and something			like a millions OCXs and VBXs. This means that they can do more <B>now</B>, but this			will soon change as more and more plugins are created that do more and more useful			things.</TD>		<TD WIDTH="21%">&#160;</TD>		<TD WIDTH="18%"><B>VBX/ActiveX</B></TD>		<TD WIDTH="14%"><B>Plugin</B></TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="21%"><B>Control</B><BR>			(ie. a spin button)</TD>		<TD WIDTH="18%">Yes</TD>		<TD WIDTH="14%">Yes</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="21%"><B>Functions</B><BR>			(ie. a crashapp() function.)</TD>		<TD WIDTH="18%">No</TD>		<TD WIDTH="14%">Yes</TD>	</TR></TABLE></P><P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In relation to Plugins, version 34a was an evil version.Apparently, the plugin format was modified. For plugin programmers, the old formatwas &quot;function action(integer, integer)&quot;, but now, it's &quot;function action(aas integer, b as integer)&quot;. This may not seem like much of a difference, butit was extremely annoying, as it rendered plugins for r34 completely ineffective.All of the plugins have been updated now, and they usually include something like(r34a) or (r35) after their name to ensure to you that they are compatible.</P><P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If you are a C programmer, and are interested in creatingplugins, you can download sample plugin source code, and the plugin API from <A HREF="http://www.realbasic.com/release.html">http://www.realbasic.com/release.html</A>.</BODY></HTML>
