In the future, this area will be where I put any visions I have, any			funny things I get in the mail, or other general stuff that doesn't belong anywhere.			For this month, I only have one thing that I thought should go here, but if you want			to see anything here, just e-mail it to <A HREF="mailto:dantheox@mac-addict.com">dantheox@mac-addict.com</A>.			It should be noted that I do not work at the wonderful MacAddict Magazine or use			it as an ISP. I simply use ImageineMail, a service of MacAddict's parent company,			Imagine. Also, I actually use a normal ISP located here in North-Central Indiana			(that makes me feel REAL special...)</TD>	</TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
