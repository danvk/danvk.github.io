A huge number of features havebeen added, but because I hadn't started this magazine at the beginning of this month,I haven't recorded some of the bigger ones, but this is something that I intend todo in the future. However, I do remember the biggest addition: Plugins. There isa large section on Plugins in the next section of this magazine.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#0066FF">&#160;Future versions?</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><FONT SIZE="6"><BR>&#160;&#160;</FONT>&#160;&#160;I recently had the good fortune of being involvedin a chat at the ever-excellent Realbasic Caf&#233; that included Geoff Pearlman,a person from REAL software.

Howerver, I was delighted			to find that this was changed in r35a. To the left is a screenshot of the controls			in r35a. As you can see, they match the kaleidoscope color scheme that is running			(it's Scherzo). It didn't do this before, and it makes me quite happy that this has			changed. However, not everything is savvy, as you can see from the screenshot. Tab			panels are the biggest problem, but the borders of text and listboxes are also bad.			The problem for the editfield (if you haven't noticed), is that the highlight and			shadow colors don't match the background. This is a problem for the frame too, though			that one is less obvious. These fixes would be incredibly easy to make, and I hope			that they are made in an upcoming release.</TD>	</TR></TABLE></P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#0066FF">&#160;An extrememly buggy &quot;feature&quot;</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE></P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="100%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="50%">&#160;&#160;&#160;In the release notes for DR1r35a, it said that RB now had the first			part of a VB importer. This allowed you to drag Visual Basic's .frm files into a			project (.frm files are the equivalent of what RB makes when you drag a window out			of the project window and it becomes a file). <BR>			&#160;&#160;&#160;Since I had a copy of Visual Basic 3 on my DOS card, I decided			to test this. First, I made a simple form with a label, a check box, an option button,			and two push buttons. Then, I exported it in the two formats that VB3 can handle-text			and binary. I then copied the files to a floppy disk, and brought them to the Mac			that I use RB on.<BR>			&#160;&#160;&#160;To test this, I made a new project, and dragged the binary form			into it. The computer immediately crashed. Then, I tried the text form . Again, it			crashed. Then I opened the text form in Simple Text, and removed the box characters			(these are at the start of every line of a windows text file when viewed on another			computer. This is because PCs and Macs record return characters differently). I saved,			and dragged it on. Again, it crashed.<BR>			&#160;&#160;This was starting to get annoying, so I tried some other stuff.
