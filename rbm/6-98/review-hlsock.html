However, Hotline protocol allowsusers to send messages to eachother, use public chats, news, upload and downloadfiles, haave limited/unlimited abilities based on an account, and start private chatswith one or more people. These abilities make hotline a great program. Currentlythough, there is only one complete Hotline Client (Netscape is an http client): HotlineClient, by Hotline communications. With that, you can access all kinds of servers,such as cafe.realbasic.com, which is the premiere server on hotline for all yourRealbasic needs. I <B>strongly</B> reccomend that you get hotline and go there toget plugins, source code, reusable classes, advice, and the latest version of realbasic(the latest release is usually 500K smaller, and you can download it in chunks).</P><P>&#160;&#160;&#160;Now, back to Hotline Socket Lite. This package consists of aclass and a module. The class is a subclass of the Serial control which allows youto use Hotline protocol. It allows you to connect to a server, log in, and use thechat. It does these in simple, self explanatory methods, which make the sample programall the documentation that is neccesary.</P><P>&#160;&#160;&#160;Well, that's just about where the good stuff ends. This programis great, but it is <B>extremely</B> limited. First of all, the only useful thingit does is chat. There's a heck of a lot more to a server than chat, but this packagecan't access any of the goodies that the normal Hotline Client can, like messages,user lists, private chats, and files. These short comings are immense, and an updateis drastically needed.</P><P>&#160;&#160;&#160;Hotline Socket lite is useful for building simple programs thatsend things to the chat, but that's where it loses it's usefulness. This programis in drastic need of an update which allows it full access to many, many more ofthe wonderful features of Hotline protocal.</P><DIV ALIGN="RIGHT"><P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="49%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#99FF99"><B>&#160;Pros:</B> Provides an easy way to use Hotline Protocol through Realbasic.<BR>			<B>&#160;Cons:</B> Can only log in and use the public chat.
