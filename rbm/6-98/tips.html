However, as everyone knows,you can add them with ResEdit. Doing it is simple. </P><P><B>Method 1-A resource editor<BR>&#160;&#160;</B>Just open up Realbasic in ResEdit or the far superior Resourcer,and open the Edit MENU resource. Then, add the shortcuts Cmd-Opt-V (V=Variable),and Cmd-Opt-M. They will appear as an accent and a check mark, but that's OK. Theystill work. The only problem with this is that every time you get a new version ofRB, you have to do this again.</P><P><B>Method 2-A macro utility</B><BR>&#160;&#160;This is a better method because you don't have to modify RB every singletime you download it. Any macro utility will do for this, though I personally thinkthat OneClick leaves everything else in the dust. Simply make two new macros thatchoose the two menu items, and assign them shortcuts. Since the Realbasic applicationis always called &quot;REALBasic&quot;, you won't have to create these again everytime you get a new version.</P><P><B>Method 3-Write mail to </B><A HREF="mailto:geoff@realbasic.com"><B>geoff@realbasic.com</B></A><B><BR></B>&#160;&#160;Using this method, everyone writes mail to geoff@realbasic.com, andrequests that he include shortcuts built in.<BR><FONT SIZE="5"></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="5">  Tip #2</FONT><FONT SIZE="4"> </FONT><FONT SIZE="5">- Save beforeyou run macro</FONT></P><P>&#160;&#160;Realbasic crashes a lot. A heck of a lot. More than any other appI've ever used. And it crashes in such interesting ways…<BR>&#160;&#160;Anyway, the point of this is that since it crashes a lot, you shouldsave your work a lot. The problem with this is that it seems that just before itcrashes, the save command stops working (Arggh...). What seems to work for me issimply holding down Command and S. This saves it many times, and almost entirelyensures that it works. Once again, OneClick or another utility can simplify thiswhole thing. In OneClick, just use this script:<BR><BR><TT>Repeat 10<BR>&#160;&#160;SelectMenu &quot;File&quot;, &quot;Save&quot;<BR>End Repeat<BR>SelectMenu &quot;Debug&quot;, &quot;Run&quot;</TT><BR><BR>If you assign this to be Cmd-R, then it will do it whenever you use the keyboardshortcut to run. This is a big time saver.</BODY></HTML>
