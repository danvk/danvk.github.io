Just look at your preferencesfolder! Most have over 500 items in them, and some have over a thousand. Just imaginewhat life was like before System 7 and the preferences folder!</P><P>&#160;&#160;Unlike Windows, there are no real standards for making a preferencefile on a mac. The basic idea, more or less, is take all the data in your app, openup a file with your app's name, and then the word &quot;preferences&quot;, and dumpall the data in there however you like. When writing an app, the typical procedurefor doing this is to create an application object, and give it LoadPrefs, SavePrefs,and CreatePrefs methods, all of which are called at appropriate times. However, findingways to write and read all the data is often quite pesky, and takes away valuabletime that could have been spent working on more relevant parts of your project.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Steve Lobaso and David Newberry have both written packages to helpyou out with your program's preferences. They both offer very similar feature sets,and thus, they make a great pair for a vs. review.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Prefs Module X Server, which is written by David Newberry, is thesimplest of the two. Simply call the <TT>SetName</TT> method, and supply it withthe name of the preferences file, and its creator code. From then on, you can simplyuse statements like <TT>GetStringValue</TT>, or <TT>SetColorValue</TT>, which bothdo what their names imply. The <TT>Get</TT> methods all take three parameters—thename of the preference (ie, &quot;User's Name&quot;), the default value, and whetheror not it's encrypted. If the preferences file doesn't exist, the default is used.Otherwise, the correct preference is given to you. Couldn't be simpler.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Writing preferences is equally simple. The <TT>Put</TT> methods takethree parameters as well: the name of the preference, the value, and whether or notto encrypt it. Encryption is very useful if the data is something that others shouldn'tsee, such as a password. Unfortunately, Module X Server only encrypts one way—youcan't specify a key. This limits the value of the encryption feature, but it's stilluseful.</P><P>&#160;&#160;PrefContainer is similar in many ways to Module X Server. The primarydifference is that PrefContainer is a class, not a module. This makes it possibleto have multiple preferences files in one application, though that's not a particularlyuseful ability.</P><P>&#160;&#160;To start off, you create a new PrefContainer object, and instantiateit. You'll want to put this variable at a spot accesible to the rest of the program,such as the application object, or a module.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Next, you call its Init method, which takes the name of the file asits only parameter. After this, the PrefContainer works a bit differenty. In PrefContainer,immediately after calling the Init method, you set all the default data. To do this,you simply act as if you were writing data to the preferences file. This is hardlythe most intuitive setup, but it works, and it's fairly simple to adjust to.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Next, you call the <TT>Read</TT> method, which reads all of the datainto the class. From then on, this class is extremely simple. Just call its <TT>Get</TT>methods do retrieve all of your data. They each take a single parameter: The data'sname.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Finally, to write data to the file, you use the <TT>Put</TT> methods,and call PrefContainer's <TT>Write</TT> method. It may sound a bit more complex thanPrefs Module X Server, and it is. However, it's quite easy to adjust to.</P><P>&#160;&#160;If you need encryption, or need to store date and folderitem objects,PrefContainer is your best bet. Otherwise, Prefs Module X Server will do a fine job,and does it much more simply.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" WIDTH="100%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="50%">			<TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="100%" HEIGHT="160">				<TR>					<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#99FF99"><FONT SIZE="4"><B>Prefs Module X Server</B></FONT><BR>						<BR>						<B>&#160;Pros:</B> Supports 5 relevant data types.
