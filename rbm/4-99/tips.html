Howevere, you don't needr70 to do this.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="4">&#160;&#160;In any version of RB, from DR1 on up, you can typeup some text in a word processor, like SimpleText, and copy them. Then, select theproperty, and paste the text in. It can be as long as you want, and have as manyline breaks as you need. The window editor won't display it properly, but it looksgreat when you run the program.</FONT></P><P><IMG SRC="multiline.GIF" WIDTH="310" HEIGHT="149" ALIGN="TOP" ALT="This looks icky, OK?"BORDER="1"></BODY></HTML>
