To put your letter in thissection, just e-mail it on over to <A HREF="mailto:dantheox@aol.com">dantheox@aol.com</A>.I actually got a ton of letters this month! Wow! Keep 'em coming!</P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">I just read the article on the tab panels in the new issue.I wondered what are the bevel buttons to what they refer. Is it in a new versionof RB? I have a very old release.<TT> - “CHRP”</TT></FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>&#160;&#160;The Bevel Buttons require DR2r17 or higher.You can use the tab panel concepts from that article in any version of RB though.</B></FONT></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">I have read your work in the RB Monthly and applaud yourwork. Are you planning an issue on the database features? If so, could you shareearly drafts? I'm really befuddled. If not, would you conisder it? <TT>- Darin H.Duphorne</TT></FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>&#160;&#160;You're in luck...It's the cover this month!</B></FONT></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">I'm trying to write a platfrom game in RB but I am havinga few problems. I found your comments about &quot;paint tile&quot; in RB's spritesurface very helpful, but I was woundering how you would use an image/pict instedof solid color. Will you be covering more about sprites in future issues of RBM?Thanks for you help.<TT> - Daniel</TT></FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&#160;&#160;<B>Since you're given a graphics object to workwith in the DrawTile event, you could simply use DrawPicture to tile a picture. Also,if you're making a platform game, you might want to check out ActionSurface, whichis at the RB Caf&#233;.</B></FONT></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">How do you access the REALbasic Monthly magazine? I clickon the cover page or date and get a picture of the cover and a pull down menu thatprovides categories. I select the category, and nothing happens. I am using MS Explorer4.5 as my browser. <TT>- Bob</TT></FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&#160;&#160;<B>Many readers have reported that the popupmenudoesn't work with IE 4.5. Lowering your security level occasionally helps, or youcould switch to IE 4.0.1 or even Netscape. Also, this issue uses a new layout, whichdoesn't use JavaScript for navigation.</B></FONT></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">My beta-testers (which are learning RB) both have a kindof big mac with tons of ram and they have tons of peripherals and hard disks. Now,I looked in the letters part of RB monthly: someone was saying that he was dl at20k/sec. I have a performa 603e/160 with 32Meg of ram, one 2Gig hard disk and a 28.8modem. I consider it is enough for what I do. Am I the only one to have such a smallthing? Do all RB developers have a &quot;big&quot; mac with huge amounts of ram andsuper fast connections, and am I the only one to be happy about a &quot;normal&quot;mac :-)? I think you should do a survey to find out what kind of mac RB developershave. <TT>- Louis Chartrand</TT></FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>&#160;&#160;You're far from alone! I use a Powerbook3400/240, which has specs that are only slightly better than your computer's. Andbefore I got my PowerBook, I used a 33Mhz '040 w/ a 500 Meg HD, and 8 Megs of RAM.Boy was RB slow on that thing!</B></FONT></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Nice site, thanks for the effort. However, I thought you'dwant to know: it doesn't seem to like Internet Explorer 4.5. When I select a sectionof from the popup list, nothing happens. Works fine w/ Netscape, though. <TT>- PeterVerlander</TT></FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>&#160;&#160;That makes two...</B></FONT></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Neat idea! I bought RB a while back, but hadn't done muchwith it. When an opportunity came along, though, I revved it up again. I've got afew RB-related questions, but I'll save those until I see whether they've been answered.One RBMonthly question, though, I couldn't find the answer to: Is REALbasic Monthlyavailable on a subscription basis? Can we have it delivered to our eMailboxes everymonth? And a suggestion: You have a popup to select the section to jump to, but howabout another one to jump to another issue? That would be great for newbies likemyself, who want to read all the Tips. Thanks!<TT> - “Saint John”</TT></FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>&#160;&#160;I'm planning on starting a mailing list thatwill inform all of its subscribers when a new issue of RBM comes out, and when it'savailable for downloading. Also, I'll probably be making a massive index of all theRBM articles when we have our first anniversary.</B></FONT></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">I read your editorial, and have some comments on both ofyour &quot;opinions-of-the-month&quot;! Word 5.1 is unquestionably the best WP yetproduced by anyone (loath as I am to praise anything MS). All versions (and everycopy of every version) after that should be burned—even landfills are too good anend. Printed manuals? I have just purchsed RB 1.1. As a total newbie with almostno programming knowledge, am in small boat in a large sea (but I'm having the timeof my life!). Without printed manuals would definitely be at bottom of ocean. On-screenversions are useless when you have to hunt and peck for info. Mind you the manualsare pretty awful—not for what info they contain (which is fairly well written), butfor the info not included. Another regretable classic case of manuals written bythose in the know, without reference to those not in the know. Shortcuts—oh yes....where are they all?! I agree, it's a wierd and frustrating omission. A question—Ihave Hotline, but simply cannot locate the cafe?? Any clues? Your mag (and site)are terrific on all counts.<TT> - Michael Young</TT></FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>&#160;&#160;The RB caf&#233; is at cafe.realbasic.com,and I'm glad to see that someone agrees with my views on manuals and Word!</B></FONT></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">I read the cover story in January's RB Monthly and I noticedthat in the picture of the listbox, the font in the column heading is Geneva. I haven'tmanaged to change the font of these column headings. Could you tell me how to dothis?<TT> – Amar Sagoo</TT></FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>&#160;&#160;At that point, I was running Kaleidoscope,and Geneva 9 was my System font. So, I wasn't changing that through any means RBoffers. However, RB now uses the same font for headings as it does for the list.</B></FONT></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Hey, I read the new RBM yesterday. Why do you always actlike EVERYONE uses DR2? It's not even a freakin' BETA yet, and here you're toutingit's features without even a little &quot;by the way...&quot;.<TT></TT></FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>&#160;&#160;RBM is a magazine about RB programming, andis mostly about new features. At this point, new features means DR2. Also, I coveredDR1, so I'm used to covering the latest versions. Once again, that means DR2.</B></FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Great tips section this month though. Goto make things aLOT easier for me. <TT>- Matthew Hershberger</TT></FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>&#160;&#160;Thanks!</B></FONT></BODY></HTML>
