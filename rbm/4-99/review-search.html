So, when I found TT'sCatSearch, I was less than optimistic. However, this plugin is a far cry from theone I gave such a bad rating to in our second issue...</P><P>&#160;&#160;TT's CatSearch works by utilizing a method of the Mac OS File Managercalled PBCatSearch. This is used by a variety of other programs, most notably Sherlock/FindFile. This routine searches for files by either their creator code, file type, orone of various flags on the file. These flags include whether the file is shared,whether or not its visible, is an alias, and what its label is, among other things.The PBCatSearch routine can search with any combination of these attributes on mostvolumes (some floppies and UDF volumes won't work), and it searches them relativelyquickly.</P><P>&#160;&#160;To set up a search, you must first get a handle of a volume. The plugin'sCatSearchOpen routine will take any folderitem that points to a volume, and tellyou whether or not it can be searched. If it can, you are given a handle to thatvolume.</P><P>&#160;&#160;After this, you can set the type, creator, and various attributesyou want to search for by using the <TT>CatSearchSetFileType</TT>, <TT>CatSearchSetCreator</TT>,and <TT>CatSearchSetFileFlags</TT> methods. The first two are fairly simple, butthe last one is rather tedious.</P><P>&#160;&#160;As anyone who writes for Macs in C knows, a series of booleans, orseveral small numbers are often represented by one number. For example, true-false-false-truecould be represented as <TT>&amp;b1001</TT>. This is how TT's CatSearch forces youto set what you want to look for, and it can be quite tedious to set all the values.Methods to do these would be much more intuitive than the current setup.</P><P>&#160;&#160;After this, you start the search, and cycle through the files founduntil you get an error. This process is quite simple, and gives you a good bit ofcontrol over the search.</P><P>&#160;&#160;TT's CatSearch is an incredibly useful plugin for anyone who needsto be able to search a hard drive, but the inability to search for files by name,size, or date make it a much less useful tool than it could be.<DIV ALIGN="RIGHT"><P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="49%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#99FF99"><B>&#160;Pros:</B> Quick.
