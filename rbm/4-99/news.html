Thismeans that when you launch RB, the famous &quot;This program will expire in 30 days&quot;dialog appears. What's interesting though, is that there's no way to enter a code(1.x codes won't work any more). What's <B>more</B> interesting is that Geoff, amember of the RB team, has said that this won't be a problem, because DR2 will shipbefore that time limit runs out.

This makes movie<B>editing</B> possible.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, there is no way to put a picture <B>in</B> to a movie,so you'll be stuck with creating a new movie.
