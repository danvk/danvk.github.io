Usually, you just writean e-mail to me, and I'll tell you what your options are. However, it'd be much nicerif potential writers knew their options before volunteering. When you email me tellingme that you want to write, specify what you'd like to write, and how often you canwrite an article.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="4"><B>1. Reviews Writer</B></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="4">&#160;&#160;A reviews writer writes a review for a product onceevery one to three months. The procedure is quite simple. Find any product that isof use to RB developers (ie, a class, a module, or a plugin), use it, and write aboutit. Reviews can be anything from a page to several. Just look at existing RBM reviewsfor examples. When you're done, write down the author, the price, and where the productcan be found. Also write out a few pros and cons, and give it a 0.0-10.0 rating.After that, just send an email to me (at dantheox@aol.com).</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="4">&#160;&#160;For example, this would be something you might sendme:</FONT></P><P>A nifty Product<BR>By Dan Vanderkam<BR>www.nd.edu/~jvanderk/rb/ and the caf&#233;<BR>&#160;&#160;THis product is, as its name would imply, nifty.<BR>Pros: Super Nifty!<BR>Cons: None noticable<BR>9.0/10.0</P><P><FONT SIZE="4">&#160;&#160;Simple enough. If you can't find a product to review,I can send you a list.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="4"><B>2. Tutorial Writer</B></FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="4">&#160;&#160;A tutorial writer submits a tutorial as often as theywant. The subject can be anything, ranging from interface design to API access. Simplywrite what you want in HTML, and include all your pictures. When you're done withthe article, stuff it, and email it to me as an attachment.</FONT></P><P><FONT SIZE="4"><B>3.
