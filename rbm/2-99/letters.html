Keep 'em coming!</P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">In your editor's note, you said that there are some menusthat should have keyboar shortcuts. For your sake, just use ResEdit and ADD shortcuts!And they're fully customizable.</FONT><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000"><TT>&#160;</TT></FONT><FONTCOLOR="#000000"><TT>- Ack123</TT></FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>&#160;&#160;Then again, it's not as if companies shouldrecommend using ResEdit to add features that should already be there. And anyways,at least the &quot;New...&quot; commands have shortcuts in new DR2 versions...</B></FONT></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Thanks for your news article about my Plugin DxMidi... it'sreally stimulant. I'm certainly not the best developer on this planet, but I canmake something with my CodeWarrior and I love music development. My webring site,as you know perhaps, is </FONT><A HREF="http://perso.club-internet/premm/rb/">http://perso.club-internet/premm/rb/</A><FONTCOLOR="#000000">. You can get there the new versions of the plugin, and, in a coupleof weeks, the first programs made with my Plugin.<TT> - Stephane</TT><B></B></FONT></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&#160;&#160;Just thought I'd say first off that I enjoyRb Monthly, particularly this latest issue, with the dr2 stuff. I use dr2 all thetime, haven't started up r1 since I got dr2, and am grateful whenever someone canreveal a little more of it's more or less hidden secrets.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&#160;&#160;Anyway, I must take issue with your thoughtson Rb and boxes :-). I personally don't feel Rb should come in a box, and feel boxesare becoming more and more unnecessary as electronic distribution becomes more viable.For sure I feel it is important to have a physical copy of the software, but thiscan easily be accomplished by backing it up. Boxes inevitably make things more expensive,it's just the way it is. Marketing, shelf space, printing, pressing CD's etc. don'tcome for free and all would only increase the price. Being from New Zealand, boxlesssoftware is also welcome, as it means that we can obtain the software over the netwithout paying a premium for freight charges etc. Of course not all software is suitablefor electronic distribution, it is too<BR>large or whatever. Rb is relatively small though, so it is ideal for this form ofdistribution. CodeWarrior may come in a box, but it is infinitely more expensive,some $600 here, and it comes on 2 CD's, a Tools and a Reference CD. It would alsobe a formidable download. FWIW, CodeWarrior only comes with a brief &quot;GettingStarted&quot; manual, all other documentation is on the Reference CD, in severalformats (all roughly as bad as the others )</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>&#160;&#160; I suppose you have a point there. Then again,making it come in a box would allow it to be sold through a variety of other sources,such as mail-order catalogs.</B><BR><BR>&#160;&#160;I agree with you that the move away from paper manuals is a bad one,and I don't particularly like PDFs either. However there is the option of buyingthe manuals if you really want them. They are pretty expensive, but better that theybe made available separately than included, perhaps in a box, and pushing the priceup even more (not to mention shipping!). I would have bought the CD, and perhapsthe manuals, but the shipping was almost more than the products themselves. It wouldhave worked out cheaper to download the manuals as PDFs and have them printed out(although perhaps the printed manuals are different to the PDF ones, which seem veryscanty and not really worth paying for, especially if you already have some programmingexperience). I do quite like the online help though, apart from it being a littleslow.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&#160;&#160;<B>Still, something simple (like a Getting Startedmanual) would be quite inexpensive, and it would make RB seem more like a commercialproduct, and less like shareware.</B><BR><BR>&#160;&#160;I totally agree with you about the keyboard shortcuts. Rb *needs* more,adding methods, properties etc. is a real chore. If RB registers with the AppearanceManager when it starts up and uses Appearance Manager calls to handle menus, whichI assume it does, then you should be able<BR>to add extended key shortcuts yourself using ResEdit. I've done this with a few programsI use regularly, so the shortcuts are consistent. By extended key shortcuts I meanones like cmd-opt or cmd-shift. Most of the good shortcuts are already taken by theHI Guidelines :-), cmd-P would be great for New Property, but it is of course Print.cmd-opt-P would be ideal though. Of course, if you did want to change cmd-P to NewProperty, nothing is stopping you from changing it with ResEdit, and it is in factvery simple to do and should work with Rb.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&#160;&#160;<B>At least they've been added now. Problemis, I've always made the shortcut for New Property... Cmd-Opt-V, so I'm STILL nothappy! (It stands for Variable, which is what that menu SHOULD read...).</B><BR><BR>To sum up, I think the distribution of Rb should stay how it is, except perhaps forpeople like yourself who can order a box and be happy when the shiny new packagearrives in the mail :-). I personally don't need a box, I have too many old softwareboxes lying around as it is!<BR><BR><TT>- Jo Meder</TT></FONT></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Since you seem to think HTML is good for all. I thoughtI should point out that your site has always had bugs. On the other hand DOCMakerstand alone documents are fairly easy on the eyes and are a bit smaller than PDFs(Yes I hate PDFs). DOCMaker has the advantage of alowing actions to be assosiatedwith pictures. In effect you could have the ease of use of HTML on your desktop.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><TT>- William Lemke</TT></FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>&#160;&#160;As I've said before, I couldn't do half asmuch with this magazine in DocMaker as I can with HTML. For example, I can only havepictures at specific points which <I>change</I> based on the window size. That alonewould rule out my setup for news, reviews, covers, tutorials, and so on. You can'tmake tables either. I've tried switching to DocMaker twice, but each time, I wouldup going to HTML.</B></FONT></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Just looked at the latest issue. One thing - in the Newssection you talk about RealSoftware being at MacWorld. While that is true, MacWorldin January is in San Francisco, not Boston!. Boston will be in the summer (that'swhen I'll be able to go).<TT>&#160;—&#160;John Tsombakos</TT></FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>&#160;&#160;Doh!</B></FONT></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&#160;&#160;I was hoping to get a little more insight orbackground info on Andrew. Don't you have a bio on him with job history or anythingelse about him?</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>&#160;&#160;Yes, it does seem odd to name someone man-of-the-yearwithout saying anything about him, but it was a spur of the moment thing. Anyway,check out AppleWizard's interview with him elsewhere in this issue for backgroundinfo.</B></FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&#160;&#160;Also, you said &quot;At the start of this year,it was somewhere around DR1r20. Now, it's at DR1r35.&quot; That should be DR2r35.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><B>&#160;&#160;Oops. I live in the days of DR1 (well, maybenot...)</B></FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&#160;&#160;You said that constructors could return data.I can't quite visualize this. To where would a constructor return its result? Ifthe constructor routine gets run at instantiation time, I can't see where the returnvalue would go???</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&#160;&#160;<B>Actually, it can't return anything. It hasto return an object of the type it constructs.</B></FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&#160;&#160;MacWorld is in San Francisco this month. :-)</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&#160;&#160;<B>Doh again!</B></FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&#160;&#160;You listed the size increase from DR2r28 to29 as 0.5%. This doesn't fit my idea of skyrocketing. And BTW I have no problem downloadingfrom their FTP site. Just downloaded r35 and it took 2 minutes 43 seconds, and averagedabout 20 KB per second.<TT>&#160;—&#160;Joe Huber</TT></FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&#160;&#160;<B>A 0.5% increase isn't much, but I was referingto it's increase since the XB days (I said that DR1r27 was 2.3 Megs). And if youget good transfer rates from ftp.realsoftware.com, then you're a definite minority.Not even REAL SW themselves get good rates from there.</B></FONT></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">I just read and tried my first tutorials from the RealBasicmonthly, and have to give you my compliments. A very good site, and worthwhile information.</FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Just a single thing was wrong with the September issue,the sockets tutorial, and it may be helpful to fix this as it kept me wondering whetherit was worth trying the tutorial at all. In the tutorial it says, just above thethird picture: &quot;Now open the code editor for the socket. In the DataAvailableevent, put in the code you see below:&quot; but the picture lists the code in the&quot;Connected&quot; event, i.e., it starts<BR>with &quot;SUB Connected()&quot; and is correspondingly highlighted in the browseron the left.<BR><BR>After some puzzling I decided to boldly enter that code in the DataAvailabe instead,and it worked. But for a long time earlier I just didn't trust the column wasn'tjust wholly mixed up.<TT>&#160;- PJ Stappers</TT></FONT></P><P><FONT COLOR="#000000">&#160;&#160;<B>When I write a tutorial, I write out thecode first, and I'll wind up making a screenshot of the code editor later, so I tendnot to run the program. I just screwed up with that screenshot.</B></FONT></P><P><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE></P><P>You're right: RB needs a box with a printed manuals inside. Everytime I open thereference I have to readjust the setting (magnification, margins...). It is slow,and most importantly, I can't put a paper or a pencil in while looking somewhereelse.</P><P>&#160;&#160;<B>Exactly! PDFs will never have that charm of a nice piece of paperand a pencil.</B><BR><BR>You're right also with the missing keyboard shortcuts. But I would <B>NEVER</B> changethe setting of the shortcuts, never in Word nor in RB. You can bet that after adjustingto a special configuration there comes another program along which uses &quot;your&quot;shortcut for something quit different and dangerous. Furthermore, the most importantshortcuts are already defined &quot;Inside Macintosh&quot;,<BR>namely Z, X, C, V, W, O, S, Q, . and others like N, F, P are de-facto standards.</P><P>&#160;&#160;<B>Then again, such a utility wouldn't affect RB.</B></P><P>What about a downloadable version of the magazine? Often it would be nice to filethe issues and sometimes its easier to read offline. It does not have to be pdf (Iread your reply to Zander Catta Preta's letter), it may be html as well but in adownloadable form.</P><P>&#160;&#160;<B>There is a downloadable version of it at the REALbasic Caf&#233;.</B><BR><BR><TT>- Johannes Windscheif</TT></BODY></HTML>
