Oh well. The improvementsare primarily bug fixes, but a few of the DR2 features are present as well, suchas Nav Services, and an &quot;Import&quot; command. Fifty-Two days later, version1.1.1 came out. It's primarily a bug fix. You can get it from <A HREF="http://www.realsoftware.com/release.html">www.realsoftware.com</A>,or the RB Caf&#233;.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">New Documentation?</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;GoldenMicro Software has made a version of the RB Language Referencefor their help viewing program <A HREF="http://www.golden.co.nz/GoldenMicro/gensoftware/commander.html">&quot;Commander&quot;</A>.Click on the link to hop on over to the commander page.

These keywordsgo before a variable in a method's declaration (ie, <TT>Sub DoSomething(ByRef s asstring)</TT>). They control how the variable is passed: By Reference, or By Value.You can get acquainted with them in the <A HREF="tips.html">tips</A> section.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">Windows Improve</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160; At first, the Windows compiler really stunk. It crashed about 90% of the time,and only worked with extremely simple projects. However, there have been a lot ofrecent improvements to the compiler, and it just keeps on getting better. Some noticableimprovements this month include a wide array of bug fixes, QuickTime compatibility(which is still very buggy), and support for a lot more controls.</P><P>&#160;&#160;As a simple test, I recently compiled a program that generated tournamentbrackets and seedings for windows, and it worked flawlessly. Granted, it ran about50 times slower than the mac counterpart, but this is probably more Virtual PC'sfault than it is RB's.</P><P>&#160;&#160;A notable difference is the ability to generate MDI applications.MDI (Multiple Document Interface) is a system that is employed by many windows programsthat allows them to put many document windows into one big window. RB doesn't supportany of MDI's more advanced features, but that will probably be added soon.</P><P>&#160;&#160;However, as many people who have tried to use RB's MDI functionalityhave learned, it doesn't work too well. I compiled a simple program using MDI (youcan turn it on in the Build Application dialog), and when I ran it in Windows, ithung up the system. DR2r59 claims to fix this, but I haven't had an opportunity totest it yet.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">Ye Wee Improvements</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160; Since our last issue, there have been a lot of improvements to DR2 that werequite useful, but not worthy of a whole section in the news.</P><P>&#160;&#160;One of these is block [de]commenting. Introduced in DR2r44, this allowsyou to comment or decomment an entire group of lines with a single keystroke. Simplyselect the lines, and press Cmd-'. RB adds a “'” mark to the start of each one. Pressit again, and they're removed. Unfortunately, if a line is already commented, a “'”is not added, but it's removed when you decomment.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Another feature worthy of note is the object destructor. This is virtuallyidentical to a constructor (which I discussed last issue), but it fires when theobject closes.</P><P><IMG SRC="autohide.gif" WIDTH="278" HEIGHT="67" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0">&#160;&#160;Afeature that's simply a convenience was added in r43. There is now an option underthe Editor Settings dialog that lets you automatically hide the palettes when a codeeditor is visible. It's very useful, but it still has quirks. For example, if youopen the New Variable dialog, they show up again. It also happens if you click onthe code editor window from another application. Hopefully though, this will be fixedsoon. I still vote for a &quot;Show/Hide All Palettes&quot; command. I've made amacro for it, and it's extremely useful.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">New Tabpanel features</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><IMG SRC="NewTabs.gif" WIDTH="258" HEIGHT="174" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0"><BR>&#160; The Tabpanel control is the only thing right now that you could possibly considera container control in RB. And, with DR2r38, it just got better. You can now setit to use large or small tabs, set the font and font size, as well as the orientation(though you'll need OS 8.5). The lovely screenshot to this article's right showsits incredibly funky new abilities. It does have some problems though. On horizontallyfacing tabs, you can only fit about one or two characters in. Of course, it's stillmuch better than the pre-r38 one, which had very, very few options.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">RB goes color model crazy!</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE></P><P>&#160;&#160;Beginning in DR2r37, RB can handle color models OTHER than RGB! Itcan also display a color using the <TT>SelectColor &lt;color&gt;</TT> command. Ithas an odd syntax actually. You'd think that you would type <TT>c=SelectColor</TT>,but Andrew decided that he needed a way to test ByVal and ByRef (see another newsarticle) and thus, the odd syntax. However, it returns a boolean, so you'll knowif the user clicked cancel or not.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Also, the color object now has Hue, Saturation, Value, Cyan, Magenta,and Yellow properties. They range from 0.0 to 1.0 (0=0%, 1=100%). And, like the Red,Green and Blue properties, they have methods as well: <TT>HSV(hue as double, saturationas double, value as double) As Color</TT> and <TT>CMY(C as double, M as double, Yas double) As Color</TT>. They work exactly like the RGB function works.</P><P>&#160;&#160;At this point, you may be asking yourself, where's the K? Why onlyCMY? Simply enough, you can display any color on the screen using only C, M, andY. K is only used to add quality to printouts.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">Reference Window gets a makeover</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><IMG SRC="newref.gif" WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="167" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="1"></P><P>&#160;&#160;In r54, the reference window got a major new appearance that shouldbe considered a giant step backwards. Now, instead of the standard five-popupmenustyle that we've had since the mid-DR1s, we have a large list on the left (similarto the code editor) that has 25 folders in it. To get help on a topic, you must findthe appropriate one (not an easy thing), and then search through the list of itemsthat appear in small print under it.</P><P>&#160;&#160;If you press the &quot;Alpha&quot; button, all of the items appearwithout the folders, but you can't use the keyboard to select items.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Thankfully, some of the reference has been updated for DR2 though,but we still can't control the font used in the reference, and it still scrolls atan incredibly slow rate.<BR clear = "all"> <TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">Properties gets a makeover</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE></P><P><IMG SRC="newpropwin.gif" WIDTH="212" HEIGHT="282" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" HSPACE="5">&#160;&#160;InDR2r39, the properties window got a long-awaited makeover. The changes aren't particularlylarge, but it uses shades of gray instead of the dotted outline that was everywherein the old properties window. Also, it has a few very practical uses: It's faster,and you can tab between properties.</P><P>&#160;&#160;If you make a window with several controls, and tab between them,you'll notice that the properties window refreshes noticable faster, and flickersfar less than the old one.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Also, if you select a property, and press either tab or shift-tab,you'llmove to another property, as opposed to another control, which is what happened inthe pre-DR2r39 properties window.</P><P>&#160;&#160;The new properties window is expected to be just the first in a largegroup of appearance changes, so keep you eyes open for a new code editor.<BR clear = "left"> <TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">Toolbar gets a rearrangement</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE></P><P><IMG SRC="newtool.gif" WIDTH="94" HEIGHT="184" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="1"><IMG SRC="oldprop.gif"WIDTH="65" HEIGHT="163" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="1" VSPACE="3">&#160;&#160;As was promisedby Andrew Barry, the RB interface is changing. The second such change was to thetoolbar, which is now wider and shorter. Instead of having two tools per row, itnow has three. This means that it has far more empty spaces than it did before. Personally,I don't think this is an improvement. It simply means more wasted space. And, horizontalspace is a lot more important than vertical space in RB (after all, you have to crama code editor in there somewhere). Anyway, for those who haven't downloaded DR2r42,there are screenshots surrounding this news article. The old is on the left. Thenew one is on the right. As you can see, the new version crams more controls intoa similiar vertical space, but takes up more room horizontally, and wastes more spaceon blank squares.Which one is better? I tend to prefer the new one, but opinionsare bound to differ.<BR clear = "all"> <TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">QuickDrawLib hits 2.0</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;Einhuger software has been widely known for their many plugins (mostof which give you access to the Apple Toolbox), and other classes such as cTableControl.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Now, as the plugin format has drastically improved in DR2, Bjorn hasbeen busily updating his plugins to take advantage of these new features.
