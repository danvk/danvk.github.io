How did you get intoprogramming? <BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#FE0E00" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>Andrew Barry:</B></FONT><FONTFACE="Palatino;Times"> I'm a mainly self-taught programmer – I first started programmingwhen I was nine on my father's [Radio Shack proprietary] TRS-80 Model I (with a whole4 K). Of course my programming horizons expanded immensely when he upgraded it to16 K of memory (and the substantial improvement in the BASIC implementation thatcame along with the upgrade).<BR><BR>Of course in my early days, my programming wasn't exactly rocket science – a programthat printed &quot;Hello world&quot; and kept it on the screen was pretty exciting.<BR><BR>As I grew older, my proficiency grew, as well as the power of the machines I wasusing: a MicroBee (a hobbyist computer in the Australian market – still based aroundthe Z80 processor, though with 32 K of memory!), an Amstrad CPC (a hobbyist computerfrom Britain – I don't know if they ever made much of a presence in the US market– again, Z80 based, but with 128 K of bank—switched memory), and Amiga 1000 – myfirst exposure to the 68000 processor, and a whopping 2 MB of memory, once I addeda RAM expansion.<BR><BR>At this point I'm just about to enter a university – to be specific, Australian NationalUniversity – but one of my crowning works was a Modula-2 style compiler I wrote onmy Amiga as my Year 12 final semester project. Actually, this was a pretty nice pieceof work for an entirely self-taught compiler writer.<BR><BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>BK:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">Did you have formal training?<BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#FE0E00" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>AB:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">I've got a Bachelor of Science degree which was predominantly Computer Science based.<BR><BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>BK:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">How did you become interested in the Mac?<BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#FE0E00" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>AB:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">One of my close friends in university had just bought a IIci – we'd previously playedaround with doing games development (nothing completed, at least on the Amiga), buthere was a more interesting machine with far more potential. Of course, my firstprograms didn't even use the Macintosh Toolbox – but slowly I managed to scrape togethermy first Inside Macintosh set, and slowly but surely started to tame this new platform.<BR><BR>Once again, my learning sped up substantially once I had managed to save up enoughmoney to purchase a IIsi, just a day after they were released in Australia.<BR><BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>BK:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">How about REAL Software?

Janet handles orders, customer service and shipping. Jannice Faber in Administration,handles the accounting, is our press contact, manages our trade show presence, aswell as all of the other administrative tasks necessary to keep the company running.<BR><BR>Jason Parsley inTechnical Support is the first line of support – which takes a lotof the load off me. He also has writes and maintains the custom order system we useto automate our order processing. This system is the reason we can handle so manyorders from start to finish without requiring a large staff. Geoff Perlman, Presidentand CEO, is the main guy – he runs the company, works with me on product planning,and wrote most of the documentation.<BR><BR>We also now employ several people on contract to do our graphic design, documentationupdates, set up our international distribution, etc.<BR><BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>BK:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">Who are the other people who are important to the success of REALbasic?<BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#FE0E00" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>AB:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">The entire REALbasic user community is important to the success of REALbasic – withoutthe support, and sometimes patience, of our users, REALbasic would never have gottenas far as it has – to say nothing of future versions.<BR><BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>BK:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">The Mac has not had the same choice of programming languages as the Wintel platform.Some time ago, we had Lightspeed C, Think C, and then MPW C. Now we have Code WarriorC. There are now several versions of BASIC available for the Mac, but until REALbasic,none have seemed to do very well. In fact, one BASIC with a visual interface, developedat about the same time as REALbasic, seemed to stop being supported just as it wasreleased. Why do you believe this situation came about?<BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#FE0E00" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>AB:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">Well, it's always been a big leap of faith to implement a programming language –and most corporations are much more willing to put their engineering time into writingnew WYSIWYG HTML editors. So, a lot of the development work being done on developmentenvironments is being done by lone programmers in their spare time.<BR><BR>The reasons that a programmer wants to be writing a development environment in theirown time tends to be one of the following reasons: for fun – so they know that theyare able to do it, or for play – the programmer has some wild idea and they wantto make it fly.<BR><BR>The problem with this is that there are no commercial considerations – indeed, usuallyjust after they've reached the proof of concept, they drop the project and starta new one, because they've already proven they can do it, or because they've gota wild new idea that's even more interesting than the previous one.<BR><BR>I was, of course, such a lone programmer – but one day I decided that I was goingto stop jumping from concept to concept, and instead sit down and finish programs.Luckily REALbasic was such a broad concept, that there is a lot of room to try outinteresting concepts, while still progressing the product as a whole.<BR><BR>Turning a lone programmer project into a commercial solution requires a new or establishedcompany to take over the project and fill in the blanks. One classic example of thisis how Metrowerks transformed itself from a marginal Modula-2 compiler vendor intoa leading C/C++ compiler vendor by buying their C/C++ compiler from a lone programmer.<BR><BR>Of course, the whole process of a commercial company being interested in taking therisk with a product is related to the size of the niche and the competition in thatniche.<BR><BR>The perceived weakness/future of the Mac platform has meant very few developmentenvironments coming out in recent years.<BR><BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>BK:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">Is the Mac a good programming environment? As someone who has had to look at theOS from the inside out, just how good is it compared to the competition?<BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#FE0E00" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>AB:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">There's sort of a love-hate thing going on here. To compare the Windows API and theMac Toolbox, the Windows API operates at a higher level, but this higher level naturemeans that sometimes under Windows you're forced to be competing with the OS to findsome workaround to get exactly the behavior you want.<BR><BR>On the other hand, the Mac Toolbox works at a very low level, which means that there'sa lot more work to get a simple app up and running, but you've got a much finer degreeof control on how your program behaves.<BR><BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>BK:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">I'm surprised to hear that. So many of the older DOS programmers used to complainabout the Mac, saying that they'd never program on a computer where the ability tocontrol to computer was to such a large degree predetermined by the OS.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#FE0E00" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>AB:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">This is largely an artifact of the &quot;since I have chosen this OS/car/city/...,it must, perforce, be the best OS/car/city/...&quot;. I mean, they're hardly goingto say &quot;I feel like a complete idiot for continuing to support this outdatedOS&quot;.<BR><BR>While the MacOS works at a somewhat lower level than Windows, it's still a far smallerconceptual gap than that between DOS and the MacOS. (You must remember that Microsoftworked closely with Apple on the Macintosh – inexplicably, chunks of the WindowsAPI are very similar to the Mac Toolbox).<BR><BR>Once upon a time, I was a reasonably proficient DOS programmer – writing TSRs, usingassembler, etc – and if you were going to write even a semi-professional program,your main interaction with DOS, outside of file I/O, was a chunk of code tellingDOS to get out of your way (in the form of critical error handlers, etc). I mean,no-one in their right mind would use the BIOS for keyboard input, screen output,serial port control, etc. – it was such a POS that you bypassed it wherever possible.<BR><BR>Of course, I'd love to have memory protection – can't wait for Mac OS X...<BR><BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>BK:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">As a developer, how do you see OS X changing the user experience, both for the averageMac user and the kind of user who will purchase REALbasic?<BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#FE0E00" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>AB:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">The changes will be subtle but actually profound for the user experience – I mean,putting aside any of the visible changes that MacOS X provides, the addition of preemptivemultitasking between programs provides a far smoother user experience. For example,the first time I tried Windows NT after using Windows 3.11, while everything appearedidentical, the environment was more productive for me – because instead of variousprograms locking up the computer or using too much processing time, I could justseamlessly switch to other applications and continue working on other bits.<BR><BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>BK:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">Do you see Apple continuing to be a viable platform from the perspective of the qualityof the operating system and hardware? And how about from the perspective of its commercialviability?<BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#FE0E00" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>AB:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">Yes – I believe Apple will continue to survive, even grow, in the future, and REALbasicis planning on supporting Apple for the foreseeable future.<BR><BR>The main thing that will contribute to Apple's success is its ability to maintainits newfound commercial sensibilities. From my perspective, Apple has, until recently,worked like a bunch of 'lone programmers' – each little subgroup has been off anddoing their own little wild concept projects, while the platform, as a whole, becameneglected because nobody was &quot;taking out the trash.&quot;<BR><BR>This changed only when Apple started saying, &quot;well, even though it would bemore fun to develop our own (insert: graphics accelerator, expansion bus architecture,serial port replacement, memory architecture, network architecture, internet replacement,web browser, OS kernel, etc) from scratch, it would be cheaper, more stable, interoperable,faster time-to-market, etc. if we just licensed the technology from somebody else.&quot;<BR><BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>BK:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">Who is the typical Mac user who might use BASIC? Is this person the same as the personwho would write a program in C? Someone who might use AppleScript? Or a (now orphaned)HyperCard programmer? When should the user customize a database such as FileMakerPro, and when should he or she tackle a programming language? Which is best for which?<BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#FE0E00" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>AB:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">&quot;One ring to rule them all and in the darkness bind them.&quot;<BR><BR>The truth is that a person should always use the tool appropriate for the job. Ifall a person needs to do is some simple automation of another app, then using AppleScriptalone is probably better than using REALbasic.<BR><BR>To make a very broad generalization, existing Macintosh development tools fall intotwo categories: low level tools, such as CodeWarrior, where anything is possible,but with a very steep learning curve, and high level tools, such as Director, arefar more accessible, but are limited when you try to do things that the developersdidn't intend.<BR><BR>REALbasic attempts to span the gap between the high level tools and the low leveltools, in that it tries to be accessible to a wide audience, while having sufficientbreadth to allow the user to accomplish a wide range of programming tasks.<BR><BR>Of course if the task you're trying to accomplish fits well within the bounds ofan existing high level tool, such as Director, then you're probably better off usingthe specialized tool, rather than the Swiss army knife.<BR><BR>Taking your example of FileMaker Pro – FileMaker Pro is an excellent product, andif the user's problem is best solved by using FileMaker, then that's the solutionthat should be used – but if FM doesn't provide the degree of flexibility that theyrequire, then they should look for another solution.<BR><BR>As an aside, REALbasic 2.0 is currently under development, which will provide strongdatabase connectivity, including a royalty-free single-user database engine.<BR><BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>BK:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">It takes a beginner just minutes to write the &quot;Hello World&quot; program inmost BASICs. How steep is the learning curve for the new REALbasic user?<BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#FE0E00" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>AB:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">The learning curve is equally gentle, if not more so. When REALbasic opens, it automaticallyopens the default window – just drag a static text control onto the window and typeHello World. Then run it.<BR><BR>REALbasic contains a fairly broad range of features, but the amount of knowledgerequired to use any particular feature has been kept fairly shallow. While REALbasicis object-oriented, the user doesn't have to worry about learning OOP, unless thecode they'll be writing is object-oriented.<BR><BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>BK:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">How steep is the learning curve for the experienced programmer?<BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#FE0E00" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>AB:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">The experienced programmer should find it easy to get up to speed with REALbasic– the core language will be very familiar, and they'll get up to speed on the variousfeatures quickly. Programmers coming from Visual Basic on the Windows side will feelright at home.<BR><BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>BK:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">The term &quot;Object Oriented Programming&quot; seems to scare away some would-beprogrammers. How does OOP impact on the programming experience?<BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#FE0E00" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>AB:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">Initially, the user doesn't really have to worry too much about object-oriented programming– at the simplest level everything is automatically handled for them. They will needto learn OOP if they want to fully exploit the program, but many users get alongjust fine using just what has been provided.<BR><BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>BK:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">Your program can run Visual Basic source code. Does this code run as well on theMac as on a PC?<BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#FE0E00" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>AB:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">Yes. In fact it should run even better – REALbasic was designed to be a compiledlanguage, while Visual Basic is still mainly interpreted.<BR><BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>BK:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">Does this mean we might see some Windows programmers porting their applications tothe Mac?<BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#FE0E00" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>AB:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">We're already seeing this – we get lots of mail along the lines &quot;we have thisVB application and we're getting lots of interest from some of our Mac clients, andwe heard that you were the best way of porting VB programs to the Mac&quot;.<BR><BR>In fact, with the RB 2.0 Pro feature of transparent cross-compilation to Windows,we've got some users who are planning to drop VB entirely and do all of their developmentin REALbasic – whether targeting Mac and Windows, or sometimes even if they're onlygoing to be targeting Windows.<BR><BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>BK:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">It would be quite a pleasure to see the Mac helping out its unwanted offspring, Windows!Much has often been made of the difference between BASIC and C. Some claim that BASICis a high level language, and therefore cannot have the degree of control of theMac and the speed of execution of C code. They say that this means that &quot;serious&quot;programs can't be written in BASIC. How does REALbasic stack up in this regard?<BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#FE0E00" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>AB:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">There's actually a couple of different strands to this question, so I'll try andaddress each of the components. Purely from the language standpoint, REALbasic offersseveral advantages over code written in C: true dynamic-length strings (includingDBCS support), array bounds checking, garbage collection, and pre-emptive multitasking.All of these things require a certain amount of overhead, so in that respect, C codewill typically execute faster than the equivalent piece of REALbasic code. Of course,a piece of C code is much more likely to crash – and if you hand-code into the Ccode the equivalent safety features, the speed much more closely approximates thespeed of the REALbasic code. REALbasic version 2 has some options that allow theoverhead to be reduced to some extent, but at least until version 3, there will bea slight speed disparity. Also, REALbasic offers a rich environment of windows, controls,and classes that encapsulate the commonly used Mac OS Toolbox services. While theseoffer lots of features and capabilities, it's certainly true the sometimes peopleneed a finer degree of control than a 'one-size-fits-all' implementation can provide.<BR><BR>The traditional way a high level environment gets past limitations, whether in speedor in features, is through a plugin architecture, and REALbasic is no different inthis regard. REALbasic supports its own plugin format, which offers the best levelof integration. Plugin writers can write new methods, classes, and controls whichseamlessly integrate into the product. Hypercard has a popular plugin extension usingXCMDs/XFCNs, which people used to add many features to Hypercard that it didn't intrinsicallysupport. REALbasic programs can also use XCMDs/XFCNs. Apple introduced the Code FragmentManager for the PowerPC, which was about their fourth attempt at a shared libraryfacility. REALbasic programs can directly call into CFM shared libraries, which alsoincludes the entire Mac Toolbox. While REALbasic has intrinsic routines for constructingAppleEvents for inter-application communication, sometimes it's a lot easier to writean AppleScript – which can also be easily utilized by REALbasic programs.<BR><BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>BK:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">Plug-ins and XFCN's are very important to the viability of a programming language.What are some of the more useful XFCNs that you have seen for REALbasic?<BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#FE0E00" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>AB:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">We support our own custom plugin format. Some of the more interesting plugins thathave been written include Additional toolbox support, Quickdraw 3D support, and Javasupport.<BR><BR>While it's true that people probably wouldn't be writing Photoshop entirely in REALbasic,it's entirely conceivable that they could write all of the image processing stuffin a plugin (written in C) and do up the entire interface in REALbasic.<BR><BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>BK:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">Does the smaller user base for the Mac detract from the economic incentive to writea Mac program?<BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#FE0E00" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>AB:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">Well, it depends. You should never really judge platforms by the entire size of theuser base, but by how many copies you think you can sell. (Yes, I know this is cold-heartedcapitalism, but if you want to be successful...)<BR><BR>So in my mind, the Mac market was a lot more attractive than the Windows market,because the product would have a far greater possibility of success in the under-subscribeddeveloper tools market – while we would have been completely overshadowed by productssuch as Visual Basic on the Windows platform.<BR><BR>Generally, I don't think that writing programs in REALbasic should restrict themfrom deploying on other platforms – the 'pro' version of REALbasic 2 will containa fairly transparent cross-compiler for Windows, and you should expect to see morecompilation targets in future versions.<BR><BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>BK:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">I recently acquired a very useful freeware program, called &quot;Sigerson,&quot;which is a program which helps in creating Sherlock sets under Mac OS 8.5. I wasimmediately impressed with how well it worked and its truly delightful interface.It wasn't until using the program for a while and checking the &quot;About&quot;box that I learned it was made with REALbasic.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#FE0E00" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>AB:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">People who talk about how &quot;serious&quot; programs can't be written in a highlevel language are usually just chest-beaters who feel that the only way to writesomething is by doing it the hardest way possible.<BR><BR>If we're thinking of the same article, the columnist's opinion was something alongthe lines of &quot;high level tools encourage amateur programmers to write software.&quot;He rationalized this with a set of the standard arguments, including: &quot;To behonest, I don't want just anybody making software. If you don't know what a guardpage is (...), then you shouldn't make software for anyone but yourself and a fewfriends.&quot; &quot;If you want something done right, you do it yourself. You don'tlet some application make buttons for you, you do them yourself. You don't drag anddrop a pop-up menu, you make it yourself.&quot;<BR><BR>Personally, I'm all for people expressing their creativity – perhaps Sigerson wouldnever have been created if REALbasic didn't exist.<BR><BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>BK:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">REALbasic has a large and very active community of users. There seem to be very manymessage boards where users swap advice and code. How important are they to the successof REALbasic? Do you get involved with them at all?<BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#FE0E00" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>AB:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">The active community of users is extremely important to REALbasic – as they are ourevangelists, as well as providing a lot of self-help for the community. I try tomaintain a presence on the main REALbasic lists – both to answer questions that nobodyelse can, but I also lurk a lot, seeing where people are running into limitations,and keeping a list of future enhancements to the software.<BR><BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>BK:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">Most people who have programmed in BASIC have encountered a code monster, calledGarbage Collection, that could stop a program dead in its tracks for no apparentreason. It has been a problem for BASIC but not for other languages. Why does BASICuniquely have this difficulty? How does REALbasic handle garbage collection?<BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#FE0E00" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>AB:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">Well, this was more of a problem with BASIC implementations running on those oldslow machines, where BASIC would probably be the only language that would have thetemerity to attempt to have garbage collection – and the style of garbage collectionused would require periodic scans of the entire heap to flush out all of the unusedobjects, which caused the hiccups that you remember.<BR><BR>REALbasic uses a progressive garbage collector, which causes the expense of garbagecollection to be spread out evenly across the entire execution time – removing thoseirritating hiccups.<BR><BR><BR></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000099" FACE="Palatino;Times"><B>BK:</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Palatino;Times">One last question.
