Usually, this method would give you an error sayingthat it's &quot;expecting an lvalue&quot;:</P><P><TT>Sub DoSomething(s as string)<BR>&#160;&#160;s=&quot;Hello!&quot;<BR>End Sub</TT></P><P>&#160;&#160;It gives you this error because you're not allowed to directly modifya parameter. This is because they're passed by their value. RB has no idea whichvariable s actually represents; it just knows its value. However, if we change theroutine to this:</P><P><TT>Sub DoSomething(ByRef s as string)<BR>&#160;&#160;s=&quot;Hello!&quot;<BR>End Sub</TT></P><P>&#160;&#160;Then we don't get an error! S is now passed to DoSomething as a variable,not a value (specifically, it's passed BY REFerence, thus ByRef). This means thatwe can treat it like any normal variable, including changing its value.</P><P>&#160;&#160;ByVal is still the default, but ByRef is a welcome feature.<H2>Tip #2 - Radio Buttons w/o frames</H2><P>&#160;&#160;If you've ever worked with the RadioButton control, you know thatit's a major pain. Only one can be selected at once, unless you add ugly lookingframes to your window, like so:</P><P><IMG SRC="image22.gif" WIDTH="274" HEIGHT="222" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P><P>&#160;&#160;However, this grouping system also works if the frames are invisible(sort of like tab panels–see &quot;Tabs, but no panels&quot;). So, if we make bothof the frames invisible, we could make a nicer interface–like this:</P><P><IMG SRC="image23.gif" WIDTH="274" HEIGHT="222" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P><P>&#160;&#160;Sure, your window may look ugly in the editor, but the finished workis much nicer, and that's all that really matters.</BODY></HTML>
