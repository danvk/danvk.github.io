As some readers (including CanvasSprite's author)have pointed out though, I failed to mention how horrid the new SpriteSurface reallyis.</P><P>&#160;&#160;If you tried to run the sample that was provided however, you wouldhave found that it ran extremely slowly. Unfortunately, even if you change the SpriteSurface'sframe rate, it's still equally slow. This is because the new SpriteSurface automaticallydetects the maximum number of frames per second it can acheive, and then switchesits speed to that. You have absolutely no control. And, as many an aspiring gameprogrammer who has used DR2 will tell you, it stinks.</P><P>&#160;&#160;David Newberry, the author of CanvasSprite, is one such person. However,unlike most others, he decided to do something about the situation. CanvasSprite,an open source canvas subclass, was the result.</P><P>&#160;&#160;CanvasSprite attempts to mimick the SpriteSurface in every way itcan. The result is an easy transition from a SpriteSurface to CanvasSprite for almostall programs. It has its own special Sprite class, and it uses the same events andmethods (NextFrame, Collision, KeyTest, etc.) as the SpriteSurface. Though it doesn'tsupport the new DR2 features for the SpriteSurface (tiles), it doesn't really needto. And, perhaps most importantly, it gives you total control over the frame rate.However, even with all these great features, there is one that stands out above allthe others.</P><P>&#160;&#160;People who have been using RB since DR1r31 (the last version beforethe name change) will remember how momentous the SpriteSurface's introduction was.Before this, creating games with any kind of animation was almost impossible usingCrossBasic (as it was then called). What few may remember though, is that the REALSW team said that they were &quot;looking into allowing the SpriteSurface to runin a Canvas&quot;. Like many good ideas, this one hasn't been touched since. Andthat's where CanvasSprite comes into play.</P><P>&#160;&#160;As you may have gathered by now, CanvasSprite can run in any canvasin any window. There's no need to black out the screen, and hide the menu bar. Thisallows the creation of significantly better games in RB. After all, the SpriteSurfacemade animation easy–but it was hardly practical for simple things. The CanvasSpriteclass <B>is</B> good for small things, and large things as well.</P><P>&#160;&#160;CanvasSprite's goal is to mimick the SpriteSurface as closely as possible,and run in a canvas. And, thankfully, it succeeds in remarkable fashion.</P><DIV ALIGN="RIGHT"><P><TABLE BORDER="0" WIDTH="52%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#99FF99"><B>&#160;Pros:</B> Lets you use sprites in a Canvas!
