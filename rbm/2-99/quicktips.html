However,if you have a window with a ton of controls, dragging becomes incredibly slow. So,always keep in the back of your mind that you can hold down the Command key as youdrag to temporarily disable this snapping behavior. You'll be shocked at just howincredibly quick and smooth dragging is.</FONT></P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" WIDTH="100%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="4%"><FONT SIZE="5"><B>2</B></FONT></TD>		<TD WIDTH="96%"><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE>		</TD>	</TR></TABLE></P><P><FONT SIZE="4">&#160;&#160;When working with a canvas control, flickering is yourgreatest enemy. It's easy enough to avoid though. Instead of drawing directly tothe canvas, first draw to a picture object, and then draw that picture to the canvas.Goodbye, flickering.</FONT></P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" WIDTH="100%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="4%"><FONT SIZE="5"><B>3</B></FONT></TD>		<TD WIDTH="96%"><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE>		</TD>	</TR></TABLE></P><P><FONT SIZE="4">&#160;&#160;Personally, I think that RB's code editor is an overlygraphical piece of junk. However, it does offer a very convenient use of contextualmenus. Just control click the code editor, and voila! A complete hierarchial popupmenuof every event in the window/module/class.</FONT></P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" WIDTH="100%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="4%"><FONT SIZE="5"><B>4</B></FONT></TD>		<TD WIDTH="96%"><HR SIZE="1" NOSHADE>		</TD>	</TR></TABLE></P><P><FONT SIZE="4">&#160;&#160;When you're writing a program, you'll often need toput in a quote.

There are much more logical ways to do branching.However, RB also has an undocumented goto command, and it can be handy in a pinch.This code only makes the computer beep twice.</FONT></P><P><TT>beep<BR>Goto NextLine<BR>beep<BR>NextLine:<BR>beep</TT></BODY></HTML>
