This is because many people have responded to my request to write for RBM,and they've been a huge help! More would be better though, so the request still stands.Just find something (either an aspect of programming, a technique, or product) thatinterests you, write about it, and e-mail the article to me. It's not tough, andit makes RBM that much more enjoyable.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Also, many, many, many people have asked why RBM came out so longafter its target date (February 1). Well, there were a lot of reasons. The coverstory (which was going to be something else) wasn't submitted on time, I got a badcase of the flu, and watched Star Trek videos for a week, and the list goes on andon. From now on, I'll just release RBM whenever I have enough content. Granted, thismay make the &quot;M&quot; inaccurate, but it'll make new readers want to learn aboutRBM's history.</P><P>&#160;&#160;And now, for my famous (or perhaps not-so-famous) opinion-of-the-month...</P><P>&#160;&#160;As many of you know, I write the popular httpSocket class. Recently,I came out with a new version. One of the major difficulties with coming out withthis version however, was creating a version of it that worked with RB 1.x. Simplymaking the code work with 1.x was not difficult. In fact, it only involved changingone routine in a very small way. However, actually getting the class and accompanyingexample project into the only 1.x version of RB that I had (F7) was a royal painin the you-know-what. My epic journey follows...</P><P>&#160;&#160;To start off, I tried the obvious things. I opened up DR2r57, anda new project in F7. Then, I dragged the httpSocket class to the desktop, and thento the project window in F7. The result was a crash (typical RB—it doesn't tell youthat something's wrong, it just crashes).</P><P>&#160;&#160;After that, I tried some things with Resourcer, but needless to say,they resulted in about 5 crashes, and no progress.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Finally, I decided to try the most round-about way that could possiblybe imagined. I created a OneClick (thank God for that utility!) palette that gotinfo on every method, copied out the info, copied out the content, and then addedit to the clipboard. I did this for 25 methods, which actually took only 65 seconds(though actually writing the script took longer). Then, I simply made another buttonin F7 that took that same data, and put it back into a class. Like I said, it waspretty darned round-about.</P><P>&#160;&#160;However, the important thing was that it worked! After that, I couldsimply copy controls from r57 to F7 (which works, thank goodness), and pasted incode by hand. It wound up taking approximately two hours, but hey, it was fun! (yeah,yeah, I have a wierd idea of fun)</P><P>&#160;&#160;However, my point is simple. If that's the only method I can findof going from DR2 to 1.x that works, then there's something seriously wrong. In aprogram like Visual Basic, this would have been simple. I could have copied out allthe variables in one fell swoop (Microsoft realizes that most programmers don't needa slow graphical interface to add variables), and pasted them in the same way. Icould have also exported the project as text (which RB can do as well), and thencopied and pasted in all the methods at once (another example of how a practicalway of making methods is better than RB's cutesy-graphical way).</P><P>&#160;&#160;If things like this continue, and REAL SW still refuses to commenton why they won't give us API access (other than saying that it's not because theywant to make a plugin niche), then the only thing I can conclude is that they don'ttake us seriously—something I hope isn't true.<BR><BR>- <A HREF="mailto:dantheox@aol.com">Dan Vanderkam</A> </MULTICOL></BODY></HTML>
