This should arrive sometimein January (probably soon after you read this), and will be a VERY welcome improvementto the release notes that we have to work with now (and the cover story of course...)If you can't wait until then, you can still get a good idea of the new features inDR2 releases–after all, the release notes are now provided with the stuffit archive.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">Expiration!</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;For many people, shock was the first reaction, as the infamous &quot;Yourdemo has expired&quot; dialogs popped up whn opening a version DR2.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Don't panic though!

Why would a good person like Bjorn leave RB to go to that <I>other</I>company? Tech Support. According to him, Microsoft's tech support is excellent,but none of his inquiries to REAL SW have been answered in the past six months.</P><P>&#160;&#160;Not providing good tech support is a very bad move, and as Bjorn'scase has shown us, it can be costly to the RB world as well.</P><P><TABLE BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="1" WIDTH="75%">	<TR>		<TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#66FFFF">Patches?</FONT></TD>	</TR></TABLE><BR>&#160;&#160;As you may have realized, the size of the RB app has been skyrocketingrecently. DR2r29 weighed in at a hefty 4.3 megabytes. For some comparison, CrossBasicDR1r27 was only 2.3 megabytes! This problem is escalated by the fact that the onlyplace to get a DR2 release is ftp.realsoftware.com–one of the slowest servers onthe internet. One solution is obviously to trim down RB. Another is to speed up theFTP server. However, the most likely alternative is for patches from one versionto the next to be uploaded. I made a DR2r28-&gt;DR2r29 patch with ResCompare on mycomputer.

New features includethe ability to put checkboxes in any single cell/column, as well as making the textof a cell/column editable while the program is running (check out the picture tothe right). It still has a small bug with the editable cells though—the edited textisn't at the same spot as the normal text. You can see this from the picture.
