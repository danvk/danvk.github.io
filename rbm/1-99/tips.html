In general, <B>any</B> interface controlcan be rewritten as a subclass of the canvas! Already, people have made chart, table,listbox, tabpanel, painting, vector-editing, and HTML displaying subclasses of acanvas.</P><P>&#160;&#160;And as an added bonus, if you make it yourself, then you'll just feelbetter about it.<H2>Tip #2 - Use Method <I>Overloading</I></H2><P>&#160;&#160;Yes, yes, you're probably saying &quot;OverLOADING&quot;? What isthis guy talking about!? However, if you have one of the newer DR2 releases, youcan create multiple versions of a method with the same name that take different parameters.For example, you could create a routine like this:</P><P><IMG SRC="image20.gif" WIDTH="402" HEIGHT="111" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P><P>And then, make another routine like this:</P><P><IMG SRC="image21.gif" WIDTH="402" HEIGHT="117" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P><P>&#160;&#160;Now, both <TT>Message &quot;Hello&quot; and Message 100</TT> are validstatements. You can also make routines with different numbers of parameters thatare in different orders, and that sort of thing too. Nifty, huh?</BODY></HTML>
