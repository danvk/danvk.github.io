<h2>The Josephus Problem</h2>
<p>What is the Josephus problem? To quote from <i>Concepts, Techniques, and Models
of Computer Programming</i> (a daunting title if ever there was one):
<blockquote>
<p>Flavius Josephus was a roman historian of Jewish origin. During the
Jewish-Roman wars of the first century AD, he was in a cave with fellow soldiers,
40 men in all, surrounded by enemy Roman troops. They decided to commit
suicide by standing in a ring and counting off each third man. Each man so
designated was to commit suicide...Josephus,
not wanting to die, managed to place himself in the position of the last survivor.</p>
<p>In the general version of the problem, there are <i>n</i> soldiers numbered from 1
to <i>n</i> and each <i>k</i>-th soldier will be eliminated. The count starts from the first
soldier. What is the number of the last survivor?</p>
</blockquote>
I decided to model this situation using objects in three different scripting languages,
Perl, Ruby, and Python. The solution in each of the languages is similar. A Person class
is defined, which knows whether it is alive or dead, who the next person in the circle is,
and what position number it is in. There are methods to pass along a kill signal, and to
create a chain of people. Either of these could have been implemented using iteration, but
I wanted to give recursion a whirl, since it's tougher on the languages. Here are my results.</p>

<h2>Perl</h2>
<pre class="perl">
package Person;
use overload q("") => \&to_s;

# Create a new, living Person with the given position
sub new {
    my $invocant = shift;
    my $class = ref($invocant) || $invocant;
    my $pos = shift;
    my $self = { "position" => $pos,
                 "alive" => 1,
                 "succ" => undef };
    return bless($self,$class);
}

# Getter/Setter for successor
sub succ : lvalue {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->{succ}
}

# Create a chain of people
sub createChain {
    my $self = shift;
    my $n = shift;
    return $self unless $n;
    
    my $succ = Person->new($self->{position}+1);
    $self->succ = $succ;
    $succ->createChain($n-1)
}

# Pass on the killing message
sub circularKill {
    my $self = shift;
    my ($pos,$nth,$remaining)=@_;

    return $self->{succ}->circularKill($pos, $nth, $remaining)
        unless $self->{alive};
    return $self unless $remaining > 1;
    
    if ($pos == $nth) {
        $self->{alive} = 0;
        $pos = 0;
        $remaining--;
    }
    $self->{succ}->circularKill($pos+1, $nth, $remaining)
}

# Print descriptive information
sub to_s{ 
    my $self = shift;
    "Person #".$self->{position}.", ".($self->{alive} ? "alive" : "dead")
}

# Circle of $n people, kill every one out of every $m
$m = 3;
$n = 40;

$first = new Person(1);
$last = $first->createChain($n-1);
$last->succ = $first;

$winner = $first->circularKill(1,$m,$n);
print "Winner: ", $winner, "\n";
</pre>
<p>What's good:
<ul>
	<li>Support for statement modifiers (ie, the 'if' or 'unless' after a line</li>
	<li>Last evaluated expression is assumed to be the return value (look at sub succ)</li>
	<li>Once the class is actually defined, everything seems fairly clean</li>
	<li>It runs, quickly, and gets the right answer</li>
</ul>
What's bad:
<ul>
	<li>It looks ugly as hell, and feels like a hack. 
	Look at the <span class=code>new</span> routine!
	Without the help of <i>Programming Perl</i> (aka The Camel),
	I would have been clueless how to write this.</li>
	<li>Also under the "it's a hack" heading, I don't like how
	each subroutine begins by shifting <span class=code>$self</span>
	off of the arguments stack. This seems unnatural.</li>
	<li>Overloading the "stringification" operator was a little roundabout
	(look at the <span class=code>use overload</span> line. Again, this
	felt unnatural, and I wouldn't have had a clue how to do it without The Camel.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>So, in conclusion, defining classes in Perl is decidedly inelegant, and unintuitive.
If I were to do it often, I'd have to cut and paste that <span class=code>new</span> routine
wherever I went. That's a BIG stumbling block, and it would probably be enough to keep me
from using OO in Perl. In fact, it has been for the past several years.</p>
<p>I wanted to do some OO however, so I checked out Python and Ruby. Here's the same problem
coded using each of them.</p>

<h2>Ruby</h2>
<pre class="ruby">
class Person
    attr_reader :position, :succ, :alive
    attr_writer :position, :succ, :alive
    
    # Everyone is alive, initially
    def initialize(pos)
        @position = pos
        @alive = true
    end
    
    # For creating a linked chain of people
    def createChain(n)
        return self unless n>0
        @succ = Person.new(@position + 1)
        @succ.createChain(n-1)
    end
    
    # Kill every nth person
    # Current position in the cycle is pos
    # there are remaining people remaining
    # Stop killing if we're the last one.
    def kill(pos,nth,remaining)
        return @succ.kill(pos,nth,remaining) if !@alive
        return self if (remaining == 1)
        
        if pos == nth
            @alive = false
            puts self
            pos = 0
            remaining-=1
        end
        @succ.kill(pos+1,nth,remaining)
    end
    
    # Information about this person
    def to_s
        "Person \##@position, #{@alive ? 'alive' : 'dead'}"
    end
end

# Set n to anything much higher (like 10, say)
# And the program hangs, or has an "Illegal Instruction"
n = 7

first = Person.new(1)
last  = first.createChain(n-1)
last.succ = first

winner = first.kill(1,3,n)
# If I use puts "Winner: " + winner, I get an error:
#    in `+': failed to convert Person into String (TypeError)
#puts "Winner: " + winner
puts "Winner: ", winner
</pre>
<p>
What's good:
<ul>
	<li>Since this was my first Ruby script, I can't claim to have written good, idiomatic
	code, but it sure looks nice to me. It's far more elegant than the Perl mess, and
	significantly shorter as well.</li>
	<li>I like the <span class=code>attr_reader</span> and 
		<span class=code>attr_writer</span> shortcuts.</li>
	<li>"stringification" overloading was pretty simple, especially since this is done
	frequently in the online reference.</li>
	<li>As in Perl, there are statement modifiers and the last statement is the return value,
	a fact which I used in most of these routines.</li>
	<li>I like the flexible interpolation via #{}</li>
</ul>
What's bad:
<ul>
	<li>While the code looks great, the execution sucks. Ruby's limit on stack depth seems to
	be set somewhere around 60, which is absurdly low. This clearly prevents setting n
	particularly high. While n=40 worked in both Perl and Python, Ruby gives an "Illegal Instruction"
	error or just hangs, which I eventually figured out was its way of saying
	that the depth limit had been reached. There may be some way around it, but this limitation
	seems pretty atrocious.</li>
	<li>When there's an error in a Ruby program, the error messages tend to be pretty useless,
	usually along the lines of "There's an error in line x", if that. When I had n set at 40, I'd
	just get an "Illegal Instruction" error, which was incredibly misleading. Setting the --debug
	flag didn't help in this department.</li>
	<li>Also, and I may just be missing something here, <span class=code>puts "Winner: " + winner</span>
	told me that it couldn't convert a Person into a String, which it clearly could, since
	<span class=code>puts winner</span> worked fine.
</ul>
</p>
<p>So in conclusion, I really liked coding in Ruby, but the execution just wasn't there.
If there are any Ruby fans out there who know how to fix the problems I mentioned, I'd be
thrilled to hear from you.</p>

<h2>Python</h2>
<pre class="python">
class Person:
    def __init__(self,pos):
        self.pos = pos
        self.alive = 1
    def __str__(self):
        return "Person #%d, %s" % (self.pos, self.alive)
    
    # Creates a chain of linked people
    # Returns the last one in the chain
    def createChain(self,n):
        if n>0:
            self.succ = Person(self.pos+1)
            return self.succ.createChain(n-1)
        else:
            return self

    # Kills in a circle, getting every nth living person
    # When there is only one remaining, the lone survivor is returned
    def kill(self,pos,nth,remaining):
        if self.alive == 0: return self.succ.kill(pos,nth,remaining)
        if remaining == 1: return self
        if pos == nth:
            self.alive = 0
            pos=0
            remaining-=1
        return self.succ.kill(pos+1,nth,remaining)

# n people in a circle
# kill every mth person
n = 40
m = 3

first = Person(1)
last = first.createChain(n-1)
last.succ = first

print "In a circle of %d people, killing number %d" % (n,m)
winner = first.kill(1,m,n)
print "Winner: ", winner
</pre>
<p>What's good:
<ul>
	<li>It's very compact (shortest of the three), mostly because of the lack of lines
	to end blocks (ie, "end" in Ruby or "}" in Perl). Not having these lines does feel
	a little weird, but I think I could get used to it.</li>
	<li>I like the printf-style formatting via the % operator. I can't say whether I like
	it more than the direct interpolation in Ruby and Perl, however.</li>
	<li>Unlike in Ruby, the program ran without a hitch, and got the right answer.</li>
</ul>
What's bad:
<ul>
	<li><span class=code>__init__</span> and <span class=code>__str__</span>? This seems
	ugly, though that may be part of the "never touch anything starting with __" 
	credo coming in from my C background.</li>
	<li>Passing <span class=code>self</span> as the first parameter of every routine
	makes Python's OO seem almost as hackish as Perl's or PHP's. I much prefer Ruby's system
	of using @ to indicate an instance variable, rather than "self.".</li>
	<li>I wish I could use tabs instead of four spaces to indicate indentation.</li>
	<li>No statement modifiers, and there has to be an explicit return statement. These
	aren't major drawbacks, but I'd rather have them than not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Python isn't quite as clean as Ruby, though it certainly trounces Perl. It would be hard
not to trounce Perl. The performance was much better than in Ruby, however: Python ran the 
script for n=40 without any hitches. In the debugging department, syntax errors included
helpful information, including where in the line the error occured.</p>

<hr noshade size=1>
<p>Now for the comparison. First of all, I'll throw Perl right out. I love the language, but
not for object-oriented programming. To write a purely procedural program I'd take it over both
Ruby and Python any day of the week, but not for OO.</p>
<p>If I had my choice in the matter, I would use Ruby. It's syntax seems cleaner, and it's
object orientation doesn't seem hackish in the least. It's performance, however, left a lot
to be desired. Granted, deep recursion probably isn't the most widely used technique, but there's
no reason it shouldn't work. For a different sort of problem, I'd likely choose Ruby,
though I'm worried I might have to switch over to Python if I ran into similar problems.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the aforementioned beast. It seems to present the middle ground in this
problem. It's syntax is fairly clean though, as I mentioned, I'd rather not have to type "self."
all the time. But on the plus side, it could actually solve the problem without crashing.</p>
<p>So for this round, the winner is Python, though I really wish it had been Ruby. For most
problems, I'll go with Ruby. It's more enjoyable to code in, and that's what I'm coding
for--enjoyment.</p>
