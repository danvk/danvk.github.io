Two weeks ago I [launched][1] my latest side project, [OldNYC][2]. It's a
collaboration with NYPL Labs which places around 40,000 historical photos of
New York City on a map.  Avid readers of this blog know that I've been [working
on][3] this [for years][4].

The response to OldNYC has been completely overwhelming. Hundreds of thousands
of people have used the site. Millions of images have been viewed. Users have
left nearly a thousand comments and fixed thousands of typos in the [OCR'd
descriptions][3].

Rather than say more about the project myself, I'll let you pick your write-up
of choice. There have been many!
