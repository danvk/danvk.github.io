title: Choosing an iOS Podcasting App
time: 05:03PM CST

I recently switched back to iOS after a few years using Android. One aspect of
Android that always bothered me was that I had trouble finding a great
Podcasting app. I'd happily used [Instacast][1] on iOS, but I couldn't find
anything quite like it for Android.

I eventually settled on [Podcast Addict][2]. It epitomizes a stereotype of
Android apps: tons of features, gajillions of options and a UI that was clearly
designed by an engineer.

After switching back to iOS, I had a surprisingly hard time finding a
Podcasting app which could do everything I wanted. For me, the hard
requirements were:

  1. A view of podcasts ordered by most-recently updated
  2. Stream by default—don't download episodes unless I ask!
  3. An option to disable play-through.

In the last few years, **Instacast** received a [major update][3]. This introduced a new player interface which doesn't work on the iOS lock screen. As a result, you can't use the play/pause/volume features on your earbuds!

It also lacks the ability to sort podcasts by most-recently-updated. I subscribe to a mix of podcasts that update [frequently][4] and [infrequently][5], so I find this to be a far more useful view than a complete list of all episodes. In particular, I don't want an hourly podcast to crowd out less frequently updated shows.

So I set out to find a new Podcasting app. I really wish the iOS App Store had a try-before-you-buy option. Order-by-date is a fairly obscure feature, and it was impossible to determine if an app supported it without buying it.

Since I spent about $10 trying out apps and deleting them, here's my guide to spare you that chore!

#### Instacast
As I mentioned, it's missing the order by most recently updated feature and the ability to control playback via the lock screen.

#### Overcast
Overcast is the best looking of the bunch. I appreciate its freemium model and functional shoutouts to alternative apps—they made moving my list of feeds between apps painless.

That being said, I had a few problems with Overcast:

- It doesn’t support streaming
- Disabling play-through is a paid feature (which is fine, but it's worth noting!)
- It makes a distinction between all episodes and unplayed episodes for each Podcast which I don't find to be very helpful. I'm not a completist—I tend to pick and choose episodes.
- It's very aggressive about downloading new episodes!

#### Podcasts (built-in app)
Podcasts is a barebones app for listening to Podcasts. I couldn't tell if it supported streaming (I don't think it does) and it definitely doesn't support showing your podcasts ordered by when they were last updated. Next!

#### PodCruncher
This app came up when I searched for Downcast on the App store and looked promising. Unfortunately, it hasn't been updated for the new "flat" look in iOS 7 and it doesn't support the larger screen on the iPhone 6. It also lacks the most-recently-updated view.

#### Downcast
Finally I found [Downcast][6], which meets all my Podcasting needs. It lets you order your podcasts by most-recently updated, though the option is tricky to find (Edit→Sort→Publication Date):

And there's an option to disable play-through on the player screen, if you can recognize it:

Next on my list to try were Pocket Casts and Castro, but I stopped when I found that I was happy with Downcast.

After all this, I'm coming to appreciate that everyone has different ways of using their podcasting app, which makes designing them hard. I don't care at all about Smart Playlists (which many apps emphasize) and I care about slightly obscure features like ordering my podcasts by when they were updated. This is a case of [dangling by a trivial feature][7].
