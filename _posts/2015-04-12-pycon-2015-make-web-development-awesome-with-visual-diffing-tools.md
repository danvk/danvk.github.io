Here's the [video][9] of my talk from PyCon 2015, [Make web development awesome with visual diffing tools][1]:

Here are the [slides][2] for the talk:

The two tools referenced are:

  * [dpxdt][3] for generating screenshots
  * [webdiff][4] for viewing image diffs

I used [comparea][5] and [dygraphs][6] as sample apps for the demos.

If you enjoyed my talk, you might also enjoy [Brett's][8] talk from a few
years ago, [The Secret of Safe Continuous Deployment: Perceptual Diffs][7].
It goes into more depth on how screenshots can facilitate rapid deployment.
