summary: There was a spike of traffic to Comparea over the weekend. Awesome! All of it came from Facebook and went to a comparison of France vs Australia. I'd hoped to get insights into this using "Facebook Insights", but came away very unenlightened.

There was a spike of traffic to [Comparea](https://www.comparea.org) over the weekend:

Awesome! All of it came from Facebook and went to a comparison of [France vs Australia](https://www.comparea.org/FXX+AUS):

I can easily get insight into who [tweeted
it](https://twitter.com/TeachingIdeas/status/520656010391093248). But Facebook
is a big black box. In theory, I can use [Facebook
Insights](https://www.facebook.com/FacebookInsights) to track this. It claims
that 50 actions have led to ~2400 visits to my site, but declines to say anything more:

I understand that Facebook is more private than Twitter, but this is
frustrating. I'd hope to at least see which country the shares are happening
in. Are these French people coming to Comparea? Australians? Facebook won't
even reveal that all the recent visits are to a single URL! I'd think that
thousands of clicks would be enough to provide anonymity there.

I'm not sure exactly what sorts of insights Facebook can share without
revealing identities, but I'd very much hoped for more than this.

Has anyone had positive experiences with Facebook Insights?
