# Dan's Catskills Adventures

The idea is to collect all my Catskills hikes on a public website. I got a lot of value out of [this 2013 blog][1] while planning hikes, and I'd like to "pay it forward" by sharing my own notes and hikes.

Things to include:

- Blog post for each hike with photos
- Interactive map with all hikes
- Notes on planning / logistics

## TODO

- [ ] Collect GPX data for all hikes
- [ ] Collect photos for all hikes
- [ ] Collect notes for all hikes
- [x] Make slugged directories for all hikes
- [x] Make spreadsheet listing of all hikes
