# Windham (solo)

My first hike of the pandemic. Not sure why I did this on a Thursday rather than a Covid Wednesday. I remember this feeling like a great release from being cooped up during March/April 2020 and then our self-imposed two weeks of quarantine after moving upstate.

Looking at photo timestamps, this was a pretty speedy hike! Just over 3h for ~6.5mi.

The exif data for `IMG_8929.HEIC` has the wrong GPS coordinates. Even my iPhone shows the wrong location. But Google Photos _does_ show the correct location. What's going on?
