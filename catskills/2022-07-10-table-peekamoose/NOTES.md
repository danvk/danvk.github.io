# Table & Peekamoose: The Blackburnian Hike

https://ebird.org/checklist/S114987728

Alex, John G and I hiked Table and Peekamoose. The birding was spectacular -- we heard thrushes and winter wrens throughout the hike and saw at least ten Blackburnian Warblers, including a family!

The Denning St parking lot was a cool place to start a hike â€” I'd go there again!
