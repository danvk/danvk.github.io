We tried to get Panther on our way back from a trip to the Hollow. Driving from Windham, Google routed me to a parking lot on the opposite side of the mountain from where we wanted to go. This was a mixed bagâ€”it made Panther something like a 12 mile hike instead of a 7 mile hike, but it did mean that we were walking on much less heavily-trafficked trails. We got our first red-breasted nuthatch and heard lots of Blue Headed Vireos singing along the walk. We made it to Giants Ledge but turned around before getting the summit.
