# Sugarloaf and Twin

Overnight hiking w/ Max. My first visit to the Catskills!

Memories of this include:

- Max insisting that there was a campsite in the swamp and then getting very muddy before giving up
- Hitchhiking back along Prediger Rd.

Track is reconstructed based on my photos and snapping to trails using gpx.studio. I might be able to improve the route times if Max has photos w/ GPS data in addition to mine.
