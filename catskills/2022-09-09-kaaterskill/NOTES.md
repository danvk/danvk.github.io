# Kaaterskill High Peak

- https://ebird.org/atlasny/checklist/S118410998

Hiked w/ Alex & John; we started around 11:20 AM. John was late and we started without him, but figured he'd catch up. Correct! We're slow. Not as much of a Bushwack as expected at the top, more of a narrow path with a few rock scrambles. There was a surprise viewpoint at the top, and the plane wreckage was pretty incredible to see. We thought about walking down from Hurricane Ledge but thought the snowmobile loop would be long and not that interesting. In retrospect there's a herd path marked on some hiking maps that cuts back down to the main trail, andâ€¦ it goes past another plane wreck! I'd like to come back here another time to see Huckleberry Point and Poet's Ledge, not to mention the waterfall.
