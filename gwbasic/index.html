<H2>GW-Basic Binary Program Decoder</H2>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC">GW-BASIC</a> (aka GWBASIC or Gee-Whiz Basic) was a BASIC interpreter developed by Microsoft and bundled with MS-DOS until the advent of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBASIC">QBASIC</a> with MS-DOS 5.0. GW-BASIC stored programs in memory at a time when memory was very scarce. Hence it used a compact, binary representation of code. It used this same binary format for code saved on disk, which makes it hard to read GW-BASIC programs nowadays.</p>

<p>Or at least it used to. Thanks to <a
  href="http://www.chebucto.ns.ca/~af380/GW-BASIC-tokens.html">this site</a>, I was able to write a
decoder in Python. You can find it on GitHub: <a
