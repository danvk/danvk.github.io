  <p>Use this app to play hands from bridge clubs with only four people.</p>
  <p>
    After you've loaded the boards, print them and give each player his or
    her sheet. You'll need four decks of cards, one for each player. At the
    start of each hand, each player selects the appropriate cards from his
    or her deck. Make sure you get the right cards!
