		<description><![CDATA[THEY GOT ME FOR $14.95 X 4, HAD NO IDEA THERE WAS A 7 DAY CANCEL WINDOW AND THAT THIS WAS NOT THE FREE ANNUAL REPORT WE ARE ALL ENTITLED TO. THEY HAVE A WELL-OILED AND CAREFULLY CONSTRUCTED BOILER PLATE APPROACH TO A HUGE VOLUME OF COMPLAINTS AND ARE VERY GOOD AT USING IT. IF THE GOVERNMENT IS POWERLESS OVER SUCH A VISISBLE AND BLATANT LARGE SCALE FRAUD WHY WOULD ANYONE IN THE WORLD TRUST THE AMERICAN FINANCIAL SYSTEM?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I signed up to check my credit report.  I found out I had 7 days to cancel before I was charged on a monthly basis.  I immediately called to cancel the account.  After saying several times and very firmly: &quot;Cancel my account, please&quot;, the operator on the phone said the account was canceled and I would not be charged.

A few months go by, I was charged 4 times!  I went through all these hoops to get my FULL refund of $59.80.  I know it doesn&#039;t seem much but I CANCELED my account!  I finally got my FULL refund.

I have my whole story here and well as email, phone, and fax information to getting a refund:
