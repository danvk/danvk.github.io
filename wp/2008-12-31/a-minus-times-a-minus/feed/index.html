		<description><![CDATA[Another Soln

This is not a proof, however a demonstration for a curious kid why negative times negative is positive. It may be helpful to think that when dealing with the numbers ‘-’ or ‘+’ signs are identical to ‘-1 times’ or ‘+1 times’. Here is an example:

-5 = ‘-1 times’ 5

A number plus a negative number can result zero. Lets take the number ‘1’ that is ‘+1’, then take ‘-1’. It could have been any other number. The MAIN assumption is: 

1 -1       = 0
Without losing the effect we can times the equation by ‘-’ or ‘-1’ then:
-1 -(-1) = 0

Since both equations are the same, that means:
-1 -(-1) = 1 -1

that means: 
-(-1) = 1

it shows:

‘-’ times ‘-’  is plus
----------------------------------------------------
This approach is also helpful to show why ‘+’ times ‘-’  is ‘-’

Let us safely assume ‘1’, which is ‘+1’, times a number results in the number, i.e. ‘1 times’ 10 is 10. Then ‘1 times’  ‘-1’ is ‘-1’ . That is:

‘+1 times’ -1 = -1

That shows: ‘-’ times ‘+’ results ‘-’

		<description><![CDATA[1 * a = a,                                 ”here ‘a’ is any number”
hence, 1 * (-1) = (-1)
also,          -1 * a = -a,           ”here ‘a’ is any number”
hence,       -1 * (-1) = – (-1)
Negative of   +1 = -1
negative of  (-1) = 1, because a number plus the negative of the
number adds up to zero, for instance when  -1 + x = 0, that means x=1
From above,     (-1) * (-1) = – (-1) = negative of (-1) = 1

That shows  (minus * minus ) yields plus]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Minus times minus equals a plus,
The reasons for this we need not discuss.

OK, that&#039;s the version I tell my students.  And I tell them about both of you as well--my fine sons!   One of these days I&#039;ll try to go over Dan&#039;s explanation with them.  But he is right.  I like yours better, Jeff!

Ogden Nash?  How did you come up with that?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Minus times minus results in a plus,
The reason for this, we needn&#039;t discuss.
      - Ogden Nash 

Actually, I&#039;m not sure that&#039;s the exact quote either, nor even the right source.  Like Yogi Berra, Nash didn&#039;t actually say half the things he said.  But at least the rhythm is a little closer to matching and I&#039;ve found it cited that way at least once on-line.  I just wouldn&#039;t want your readers to think that your brother recites couplets where one line has three more syllables than the other.  :-)]]></description>
