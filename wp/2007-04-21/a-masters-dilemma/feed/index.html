		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s true, I guess it was a semi-bold move. The thing with movies is you can watch them whenever you like. I would have had to watch this at 5:30 AM. If it had been a few hours later, I would have gone for it. But it&#039;s good that I didn&#039;t, it didn&#039;t look like an especially great match. Nadal won 6-4, 6-4 (http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=2845580).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I guess it was bold of CBS. But they tried to only broadcast games that you couldn&#039;t see on television. So they also only did it while there was more than one game playing at a time. Nowadays, a movie costs $8, and lasts about as long the tennis match.
