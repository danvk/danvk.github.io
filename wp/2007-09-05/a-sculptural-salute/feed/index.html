		<description><![CDATA[What a awesome read.  Well looked at from different view points.
Peter Norman was a great man who stood up for Aboriginal rights in Australia and he didn&#039;t agree with the &quot;White Australia Policy&quot; which the Australian government enforced at the time.  He faced some hard times because of it, but he is always celebrated by the Aboriginal people.
Smith and Carlos are also amazing proud people and they seemed to have done something epic.  I do not know their impact on the American people first hand.  Only from what i read.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jeez, ya know I don&#039;t really know I found this site, but I saw the picture and read what you had to say.  I&#039;d seen the picture before and understood it&#039;s meaning, but as it happened &quot;before my time&quot; I never knew the story behind it.  

Thank you for the history lesson, explaining the little details and the commentary!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for a great post Dan and glad you discovered the truth about the random white guy. Peter Norman&#039;s mother was involved in fighting human rights abuse and his minor support made an important stand all the more memorable. His time of 20.05 at that race still stands as an Australian record, 40 years later. He passed away 2 years ago from a heart attack, Tommie and Carlos were pall-bearers at his funeral... Their dignity is amazing in the face of such adversity, even more so when compared with so many sports star brats of today...
Cheers from Sydney
