		<description><![CDATA[Solving is easy.  The hard part is creating a board with a bunch of words from a theme word list.

First you need to semi-random pick words that share letters from the theme word list such that they share letters.  Then figure out how to place them on the board such that they allow the words to be spelled.  THAT is something I have not figured out yet.  Random placement on a board does not work when you have at least 8 words ..... eg:  &#039;margays&#039;, &#039;jaguars&#039;, &#039;cougars&#039;, &#039;tomcats&#039;, &#039;margay&#039;, &#039;jaguar&#039;, &#039;cougar&#039;, &#039;pumas&#039;, &#039;puma&#039;, &#039;tomcat&#039;, &#039;toms&#039;, &#039;tom&#039;

Note there are under 16 letters in those words.  But how to organize them in a 4x4 grid to make the majority of those words ?]]></description>
