		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d be disappointed because I&#039;d expect the final to be a total blowout. Last year, Fed lost only two sets heading into the final. Same for Nadal. Nobody can touch either of them. It seems exceedingly unlikely that someone will go on a streak and beat both of them in a run to the championship. Here&#039;s an analysis of the odds that bookies are offering for various events: http://www.tennis.com/features/general/features.aspx?id=79422. In short, at least one of them will be in the final. If it&#039;s not both, it&#039;s not going to be any fun to watch.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I happened to catch espn days ago when they showed the news of Nadal. I am a little surprised that you&#039;ll &quot;be tremendously disappointed if it’s not a rematch of last year’s.&quot; 
As someone less familiar, it seems like it would be surprising if the rematch doesn&#039;t happen, and that surprising fact would be interesting in itself.]]></description>
