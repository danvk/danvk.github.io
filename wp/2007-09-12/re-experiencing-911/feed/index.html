		<description><![CDATA[I was in a Geoscience class where we were paired in front of computers. When the principal came on the loud speaker, I think every single computer went to cnn.com . This was a microcosm of the rest of the world, thus, cnn.com was completely dead. Eventually, we moved to slashdot which was linking to quite a few different news sources.

The event was both a failure and success for the internet. Since the bandwidth didn&#039;t scale like television, for centrally oriented things, the internet was worse than tv. For person to person communication, the internet was marvelous, many people were able to connect over email or im that were unable to use the cell phone networks. On the drive home, they were playing the audio from the NBC station.

We had discussions in a couple classes. Watching the towers live was like watching a movie. It was incomparable to any other day in my lifetime, another day that will live in infamy.]]></description>
