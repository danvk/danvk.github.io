		<description><![CDATA[10,000 Boards/second is impressive.

Question:  How does it scale on multi-core shared memory CPU&#039;s?

In November 2009, deepsearch.c was capable of scoring 70,000 random 5x5 boards per second with the TWL06 lexicon on a Core2 Q9450 @ 3GHZ.

How?  An immutable finite state automaton operating as a perfect and complete hash table.  That&#039;s how.

GNTRP
SMIDR

This board is the best Best 5x5 Boggle board for TWL06.  It&#039;s worth 10,769 points.  The word list is mind boggling.

search &quot;Boggle deepsearch&quot; on Google.  www.pathcom.com/~vadco/deep.html

Final question:  Why bother changing more than one tile, when the smallest change possible will lead to the best board every time?  Does your algorithm guarantee the highest possible board in a period of time shorter than over night?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Awesome stuff, Dan!

We should definitely get lunch together at some point... haven&#039;t seen you in at least a year...

Also, as a security guy, I present for your amusement: &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/danvk-boggled&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cross-site boggling&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I recall a story of two slot machines that had the exact same payout structure and frequency (ie: if you were blind, they were identical machines), but one would earn the casino far more money.

The difference was that one of them would show far more &quot;almost wins&quot; where the user was one click of one of the wheels away from winning alot of spare change.  The psychological &quot;near miss&quot; kept people at the machine longer.  Debatably, they enjoyed the experience more.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Craig: that&#039;s one of the details that interested readers will find in my code (http://code.google.com/p/performance-boggle/source/browse/trunk/anneal.cc -- only 150 lines!). I use the metallurgy analogy. There&#039;s an ambient temperature that decreases over time. At lower temperatures, I&#039;m less likely to choose a lower-scoring board. You can see this in the board progression. At first, it&#039;s pretty random. Then it starts to only improve.

Craig paragraph 2: That&#039;s not an approach I&#039;d considered, but I like it. My code is fast enough that I can easily consider all boards at a distance &lt;= 2. (more on that in a later post)

Craig paragraph 3: Reader must strip my CSS.

Greg: Sounds like an idea for a startup! =) It only took about two seconds to do the full annealing run I included in this post, so it would be completely feasible. You could even imagine requesting a low-, medium- or high-scoring board. Or a high-scoring board with a &quot;qu&quot; on it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very cool dan.

The way I way I learned simulated annealing, as time went on, you were less likely to take the lesser board. Like steel particles as they cool during annealing.

Also, I seem to remember that you considered all boards that were one move away, and typically, you took the best one of those. The annealing part was that sometimes you just took a random choice.

Finally, it&#039;s a good thing I came to comment. The color of the text didn&#039;t come across in google reader.]]></description>
