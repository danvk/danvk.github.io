		<description><![CDATA[Every week or so, I&#039;ll find myself wondering if I how much longer I can squeeze in at work before riding home without having to do it in the dark. For a long time, I&#039;d search for &quot;sf sunset&quot;, click through to TimeAndDate.com&#039;s table, find today, mkay. Then one day... BLAM. A lovely little one box with not only the time o&#039; the clock but relative as well.

I never imagined I&#039;d have the chance to thank the creator, but checked out your blog to find out a little bit about the creator of Old SF, which is another level of awesome.

So thanks a bunch for the little bit of joy and convenience that is your sunset/rise one box, Dan. Nice work!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was actually in Barrow during one of the no-sunset periods 2 years ago.  I wasn&#039;t even there 24 hours, but from talking to folks, they aren&#039;t at all upset about this period.  The snow is mostly melted, the weather is nice,  the only problem is that the roads are really muddy.  The month of no sun though seems very painful.  It&#039;s cool that the onebox considered this case!]]></description>
