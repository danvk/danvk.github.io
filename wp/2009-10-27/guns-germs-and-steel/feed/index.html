		<description><![CDATA[No, he wasn&#039;t that disingenuous. He&#039;s presenting this as a nice, clean example of two genetically-identical populations developing in isolation with only environmental factors differing. And that&#039;s true. It&#039;s just that the Maori conquering the Moriori doesn&#039;t follow from that, and he&#039;s acting as though it did. The British involvement is very, very relevant!]]></description>
