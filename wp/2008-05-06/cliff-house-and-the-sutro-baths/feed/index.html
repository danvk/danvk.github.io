		<description><![CDATA[All my life I&#039;ve wanted to visit that section of the Presidio/ Outer Richmond as it used to be. The Sutro Bath House, the amusement park that was in the very Outer Richmond when my mom was a kid... (the only thing left is the windmills across the street from Ocean Beach, just down the hill from the Cliff House).

For some reason, that section of the city, more than any other, makes me really reminiscent for the past of San Francisco. Maybe because it&#039;s the stretch that we always drove through to get to Menlo Park when I was little, but also maybe because there are so many remnants there that haven&#039;t been covered up yet in the way so much of the city&#039;s past has been.]]></description>
