		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d be shocked if enough 21-year olds are using fertility treatment to produce a 40% increase in the twin rate nationwide. If you don&#039;t believe me on 21-year olds, the numbers are quite similar for 16-year olds. Do you really think they&#039;re using assisted reproduction techniques?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[IVF certainly explains the dramatically increased twin rate amongst older women. But the real surprise to me was that the twin rate has increased across the board. Surely 21-year olds aren&#039;t using fertility treatment?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My guess is an increased and more effective use of fertility drugs in older women, which, when they work, can sometimes _really_ work. The older you are, the more likely you need help with fertility, the more likely you get the powerful drugs.

The graph also shows how older women are even _having_ babies. 

I love the infographic, I kinda want it to animate on a timer.]]></description>
