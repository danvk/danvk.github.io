		<description><![CDATA[omg i&#039;m such a now&amp;then addict.  i can stand drooling looking at old pictures forever in museums and whenever they randomly have them decorating the outside of safeways and in the library and in those wonderful books they have of old sf (and also seattle, where i&#039;m from).

i just stumbled across http://www.flickr.com/photos/library_of_congress/sets/72157603671370361/show/ -- apparently the library of congress has a modest photostream, and they&#039;ve done the best job i&#039;ve ever seen of coloring in black and whites of the forties.  some pretty amazing shots in there...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very cool photos, and nice JavaScript hacking!

Based on the angle of the shadows, it looks like the 1945 photo was taken in the early morning, while your photo was taken in the afternoon.

If you feel inspired to work on this more, it would be cool if you were to take a picture in the morning to get similar shadows and also to avoid losing detail in the upper left.  Of course to get the angles exactly right you would have to take the picture in July which is when the original photo was taken -- and sunny mornings in July are scarce in SF.]]></description>
