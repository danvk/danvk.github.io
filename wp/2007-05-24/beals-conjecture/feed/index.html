		<description><![CDATA[Dan - have you considered adapting your program to seek additional solutions to the weaker problem where one of the exponents can be 2 but the sun of their reciprocals must be less than 1? The known solutions are intriguingly distributed: apart from the semi-trivial solution 1+8=9, there are just four solutions to this in which z^r is under 15,000 and then five more where it is between 10^11 and 10^15. No others are known, but only very weak partial non-existence results have been proved (the strongest being that there are only finitely many solutions for any particular mnr triplet), and I&#039;m not sure that any search has gone very high.

Regarding the Beal conjecture itself, a search in which the exponents are all kept really low (&lt;20) seems more interesting - the density of such powers is so much higher than that of high powers that you&#039;d be doing most of your existing search, and you could take the bases up to very large numbers in compensation.]]></description>
