				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The S&amp;P 500 certainly hasn&#8217;t made anyone rich over the last year:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.danvk.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/sp500.png" alt="S&#038;P 500 dropping 40% over the last year" title="sp500" class="size-full wp-image-442" width="450" /></p>
<p>Most people see this and think &#8220;an investment one year ago would have lost 45% of its value&#8221;. Others think &#8220;great, now stocks are all cheaper!&#8221;</p>
<p>In reality, most ordinary people invest portions of their paychecks, either through their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/401(k)">401(k)</a> or a personal account. This means they&#8217;re doing <i>time averaging</i>. Sure, investments when the market was up aren&#8217;t doing well. But investments when the market was down are doing just fine.</p>
<p>This is all kind of wishy-washy, though. Let&#8217;s try to quantify it. Suppose a market drop and recovery looks like a parabola:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.danvk.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/market-model.png" alt="market-model" title="market-model" width="361" height="192" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-444" /></p>
<p>The prices here are parabolas<br />
<img class="tex" alt="P(t) = a(1-2t)^2 + (1-a)\," src="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/eq-parabolas.png" /></p>
<p>for various values of a. a=0 means the market is flat. a=0.5 means the market loses 50% of its value.</p>
<p>If you invest <i>dt</i> dollars in this market at each point in time, you can work out a nasty integral and show that the number of shares you have at time <i>t</i> is:</p>
<p><img class="tex" alt="S(t) = \int_{x=0}^{x=t} \frac{dx}{a(1-2x)^2+(1-a)}" src="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/eq-integral.png" /></p>
<p><img class="tex" alt="= \frac{1}{2a \sqrt{1/a - 1}} \left(atan \frac{1}{\sqrt{1/a - 1}}  - atan \frac{1-2t}{\sqrt{1/a - 1}} \right)" src="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/eq-indefinite.png" /></p>
<p>and hence the value of your shares at the end is:</p>
<p><img class="tex" alt="S(1) = \frac{1}{a \sqrt{1/a - 1}} atan \frac{1}{\sqrt{1/a - 1}}" src="/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/eq-definite.png" /></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what that looks like:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.danvk.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/return-averaging.png" alt="return-averaging" title="return-averaging" width="517" height="267" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-443" /></p>
<p>The x-axis is <i>a</i>, the fraction by which the market drops. The y-axis is your total return on investment. If the market drops by 50% (a=0.5) then your total return on investment is around 55%. With time-averaging, <b>the more the market drops, the better you do.</b> </p>
<p>This makes a lot of sense if you think about it. Say the market drops 99.9% and then recovers. The shares you bought when it was at its bottom earned you a return of 1000x. Investing at the bottom is important! You should keep investing, even as the market drops. If you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll miss that bottom.</p>
