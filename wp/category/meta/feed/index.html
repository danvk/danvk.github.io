It was easy as pie, and it fixed my two biggest annoyances with wp: the &#8220;Save and Continue Editing&#8221; button now works and the <a href="http://www.technosailor.com/10-things-you-should-know-about-wordpress-21/">bizarre image insertion interface</a> from the old WordPress is much improved. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also got to give them snaps for their <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/?show=popular">most popular ideas</a> page. Users rate ideas, and the most popular ones get implemented in the next release. At least that&#8217;s how the theory goes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was amazed how quickly the webspammers found the comments form on this site and started dumping cialis links on it. I&#8217;ve cleaned up the ones that made it through (there were 48 more listed as &#8220;pending&#8221; by WordPress) and installed a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA">CAPTCHA</a> <a href="http://www.protectwebform.com/plugin_wordpress">plugin</a> to prevent this in the future. For those of you who don&#8217;t know, when a web site asks you to enter some random characters in a hard-to-read image, that&#8217;s a CAPTCHA.</p>
<p>Hopefully you won&#8217;t notice, though. This is a &#8220;smart CAPTCHA&#8221; that uses JavaScript to automatically fill out the form when a real browser is visiting. I&#8217;ll see how well this works. Here&#8217;s hoping!</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> This plugin did a great job of stopping comment spam by effectively turning off comments from unregistered users. I&#8217;ve turned it off and I&#8217;m switching to <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a>. <i>(2/11/2007)</i></p>
