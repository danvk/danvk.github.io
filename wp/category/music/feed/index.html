<p>This is the last post in this series before we resume our regularly scheduled programming. I still discover most of my music through <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/">Pitchfork&#8217;s</a> lists, so I&#8217;ve included links to those lists where appropriate.

<p><img src="http://www.danvk.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/knife.jpg" style="padding-right: 5px" align="left" /><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Silent-Shout-Knife/dp/B000FWHVKA/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1199467433&amp;sr=8-2">Silent Shout</a></strong><br />
<em>(The Knife &#8211; 2006; PF <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/40007-staff-list-top-50-albums-of-2006/page_5">#1 album</a> of 2006)</em><br />
Pitchfork&#8217;s fave album of 2006 is one of my fave albums of 2007. The opening beat/song really pull you in, and the first nine tracks are all good, with &#8220;Marble House&#8221; and &#8220;Like a Pen&#8221; being standouts. The last two tracks are just miserable though, I mean “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily,_Rosemary_and_the_Jack_of_Hearts">Lily, Rosemary, and the Jack of Hearts</a>” bad. This was the only album that I discovered through the 2006 list that I really enjoyed.<br />

<p><img src="http://www.danvk.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/rainbows.jpg" style="padding-right: 5px" align="left" /><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rainbows-Radiohead/dp/B000YXMMAE/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1199467544&amp;sr=1-1">In Rainbows</a></strong><br />
<em>(Radiohead &#8211; 2007; PF <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/47446-staff-list-top-50-albums-of-2007/page_5">#4 album</a> of 2007)</em><br />
With its innovative &#8220;pay what you want&#8221; online distribution, it&#8217;s a good thing Radiohead made such a great album. It sounded nondescript the first time I listened to it, but quickly grew on me. Favorite tracks include &#8220;Bodysnatchers&#8221;, &#8220;Weird Fishes/Arpeggi&#8221; and &#8220;Jigsaw Falling into Place&#8221;.<br />

<em>(Nas &#8211; 2006)</em><br />
I&#8217;ve already <a href="/wp/?p=102">reviewed</a> this album before, so it should come as no surprise that I liked it! It&#8217;s too bad that every Nas album gets compared to his first. Maybe he wishes he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Honey">pulled a Radiohead</a> instead.<br />
<br clear="left" /></p>
<p><img src="http://www.danvk.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/18.jpg" style="padding-right: 5px" align="left" /><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Steve-Reich-Music-18-Musicians/dp/B000026258/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1199467606&amp;sr=1-2">Music for 18 Musicians</a></strong><br />
<em>(Steve Reich &#8211; 1974; PF <a href="http://cms.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/36725?artist_title=Staff_List_Top_100_Albums_of_the_1970s&amp;page=page_5">#53 album</a> of the 1970&#8242;s)</em><br />
It&#8217;s on the PF list, but <em><a href="http://www.therestisnoise.com/">The Rest Is Noise</a></em> inspired me to listen to it. I enjoyed it the first time through, but couldn&#8217;t say I was really inspired. Then I started hearing those bass clarinets everywhere: the sound of a bus engine, the rhythm of a toothbrush across my teeth. For bonus points, try picking out the 18 musicians. (I think this would be really hard!)<br />

<em>(A Tribe Called Quest &#8211; 1993; PF <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/36737-staff-list-top-100-albums-of-the-1990s/page_3">#75 album</a> of the 1990&#8242;s)</em><br />
I could do without the interludes, but the main tracks are fantastic grooves, combining jazz, funk and hip-hop. Favorite tracks include &#8220;8 Million Stories&#8221;, &#8220;Sucka Nigga&#8221;, and &#8220;Midnight&#8221;.<br />

I first heard Joni Mitchell in high school but was nonplussed. Then I heard a CD of songs whose names all contained the word &#8220;California&#8221; on it about two years ago. Joni Mitchell&#8217;s &#8220;California&#8221; made an appearance right after Tupac&#8217;s &#8220;California Love&#8221;. It&#8217;s certainly a ridiculous sequence, but I&#8217;m been torn on whether it&#8217;s also a good one. It&#8217;s tough to follow &#8220;California Love&#8221;, so maybe you should just go for something as different as possible. Once you get used to her voice, this is a really enjoyable album.<br />

<em>(Justin Timberlake &#8211; 2006; PF <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/40007-staff-list-top-50-albums-of-2006/page_3">#25 album</a> of 2006)</em><br />
As a friend of mine explained, we should all be thanking JT: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t even know sexy was gone, but he&#8217;s bringing Sexyback!&#8221; I was also really impressed by his concert at Madison Square Garden, which I saw on TV.

<em>(Jeff Buckley &#8211; 1994; PF <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/36737-staff-list-top-100-albums-of-the-1990s/page_4">#69 album</a> of the 1990&#8242;s)</em><br />
The most famous accidental drowning of the last 15 years. I prefer the harder rock songs to the more down-tempo ones like &#8220;Lilac Wine&#8221; and &#8220;Hallelujah&#8221;. Faves are &#8220;Last Goodbye&#8221; and &#8220;Eternal Life&#8221;.</p>

As usual, they&#8217;ve been lampooned all over the web, including one critique in <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2007/12/pitchforks_top_100_tracks_of_2.html">pie chart form</a>. For me, they made for perfect listening on a long car drive this weekend.</p>
<p>In my case, this list led to a good use of my <a href="http://dougscripts.com/itunes/scripts/ss.php?sp=trackparser">Track Parser</a> script, which is in all likelihood the most useful program I&#8217;ve ever written. It&#8217;s an AppleScript for iTunes (i.e. Mac only, sorry) that lets you apply regular expressions to track names/tags. Here&#8217;s how I used it today&#8230;</p>
<p>Through some strange turn of events (certainly nothing to do with <a href="http://www.mininova.org/tor/1054972">this</a>), I found myself with a playlist of the top 100 tracks. The music was all there, but none of the songs had their &#8220;Artist&#8221; field filled in! Here&#8217;s where my Track Parser script came in.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=list%20of%20pitchfork%202007%20singles">googled around</a> and quickly found <a href="http://idolator.com/tunes/year_end-analysis/pitchfork-thinks-lcd-soundsystems-all-my-friends-is-something-great-334602.php">this page</a>, which has some commentary on the list, as well as what we&#8217;re interested in: a copy of all the songs/artists in simple text form. (For what it&#8217;s worth, I agree with his reactions.)</p>
<p>I copied the list and ran two regular expressions to get it down to just the artist (<code>s/ ".*//g</code> and <code>^\d*: </code> if you must know). The tracks are in reverse order of what we want (100 to 1 instead of 1 to 100). So I ran <code>pbpaste | tac | pbcopy</code> to put the #1 track at the top of the list. Or I would have, if Mac OS X had the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tac_(Unix)">tac</a> command. Instead, I ran this monstrosity:
<pre>pbpaste | perl -ne 'push @x, $_; END { print for reverse @x }' | pbcopy</pre>
<p> to do the same thing. In retrospect, I should have just sorted my playlist in reverse track order.</p>
<p>Next I went into iTunes and selected my songs. I ran &#8220;Track Parser (Clipboard)&#8221; from the Scripts menu, clicked &#8220;New Pattern&#8221; and put in &#8220;%a&#8221; to extract the artist from each line. Track Parser handled the rest. Total time: about five minutes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://www.danvk.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/talkingheads.jpg' alt='talkingheads.jpg' align=right />Not being able to remember the name of a song whose instrumental part is stuck in your head. It&#8217;s maddening!</p>
<p>NPR plays these fifteen second instrumental clips from popular songs between segments on some shows. I&#8217;ve listened to enough music that I&#8217;m usually really good at picking out the song. But this one escapes me. And there&#8217;s <i>no words</i>, so I can&#8217;t search for it!</p>
<p>It brings the whole issue of literacy into focus for me. I don&#8217;t think twice about writing a thought down on paper, but when it&#8217;s a bit of music, I&#8217;m totally powerless. I can&#8217;t really reproduce it (it&#8217;s got some weird reverb effects going on) and I certainly can&#8217;t convey it to someone else. It&#8217;s a prisoner in my mind. All I can say is it&#8217;s got bass and syncopated, reverbed percussion, like Squarepusher&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.warprecords.com/ography/release.php?cat=WARP62#">Iambic 5 Poetry</a>&#8220;, only more upbeat.</p>
<p>The only way out: I have to listen to every song in my library until I find it. ARGH!!!</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> Two days later, my fifth guess paid off! It was 0:15 through about 0:30 of &#8220;Warning Sign&#8221; off <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_Songs_About_Buildings_and_Food">More Songs About Buildings and Food</a></i> by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Heads">Talking Heads</a>. For the record, my previous guesses were: Pixies, Pavement, R.E.M. and Boards of Canada.</p>

<p>Either through misplacement or theft, I lost the dano, my iPod nano, sometime last week. It&#8217;s OK. It was only a 1 GB nano, and I won it in a drawing. I paid nothing.</p>
<p>In fact, I last bought an iPod in April, 2004. Here&#8217;s what it looked like:</p>
<p><center><img src='http://www.danvk.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/ipod3g.png' width=179 height=300 alt='ipod3g.png' /></center></p>
<p>That red glow was totally trendy. It&#8217;s pretty wild to compare the technical specs on each. The prices were identical &#8211; $300 each. What&#8217;s 3+ years done to the iPod?</p>
<style type="text/css">
.thin table { border-collapase: collapse; }
.thin td, th { border: 1px solid black; }
</style>
<table class=thin cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 width=100% >
<tr>
<th>&nbsp;</th>
<th>2004</th>
<th>2007</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Price</td>
<td>$294.24</td>
<td>$302.02</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Capacity</td>
<td>15 GB</td>
<td>80 GB</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Battery Life</td>
<td>~5 hours</td>
<td>&#8220;20 hours&#8221; (we&#8217;ll see)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Size</td>
<td>4.1&#8243; x 2.4&#8243;</td>
<td>4.1&#8243; x 2.4&#8243;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Thickness</td>
<td>0.62&#8243;</td>
<td>0.55&#8243;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Weight</td>
<td>5.6 oz</td>
<td>5.5 oz</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Display</td>
<td>2&#8243;, 160&#215;128</td>
<td>2.5&#8243;, 320&#215;240</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>So all the specs have improved, and the thing&#8217;s gotten smaller. Who ever said the march of technology was a bad thing? I&#8217;m mostly excited about the video capabilities. If I throw some TV episodes on there, I can jog with my iPod, commercial-free!</p>

Consider that fixed&#8230;</p>
<p>I learned one thing from the wiki article I linked to above. &#8220;Palo Alto&#8221; was originally called &#8220;OK Computer&#8221;, and was going to be on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK_Computer">the album</a> of the same name. The song was cut and renamed, but the original name stayed in their minds for the album. It&#8217;s interesting because &#8220;OK Computer&#8221; is a fine metaphorical title for the album, but a great literal title for the song that became &#8220;Palo Alto&#8221;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Albums</b>:</p>
<p>- A Tribe Called Quest, <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Low_End_Theory">The Low End Theory</a></i> (1991)<br />
- R.E.M., <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murmur_%28album%29">Murmur</a></i> (1983)<br />
- The Velvet Underground, <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loaded_%28album%29">Loaded</a></i> (1970)<br />
- Bob Dylan, <i><a href="The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan">The Freewheelin&#8217; Bob Dylan</a></i> (1962)</p>
<p>Some albums are just inextricably associated with times and places in my life. <i>Loaded</i> wins that award for summer 2006. It&#8217;s hard to say how long you have to wait to know, but the early returns have <i>Reasonable Doubt</i> as the sound of starting at Google.</p>
<p><b>Books</b>:</p>
<p>- Kenneth Browser, <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Starship-Canoe-Kenneth-Brower/dp/0060910305">The Starship &#038; the Canoe</a></i> (1978)<br />

<p>Hopefully I&#8217;ll write more about both these books in the next week or so.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href='http://www.danvk.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/nashiphopdead.jpg' title='nashiphopdead.jpg'><img src='http://www.danvk.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/nashiphopdead.thumbnail.jpg' alt='nashiphopdead.jpg' border=0 align=left /></a> I recently noticed that a friend was <a href="http://leeniev.blogspot.com/2007/01/nas-discomfort.html">intrigued</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_Hop_is_Dead"><i>Hip Hop Is Dead</i></a>, so I figured I should write a little about it. As the two readers of this blog know, I&#8217;m a <a href="http://www.danvk.org/wp/?p=52">big fan</a> of Nas, or at least of <i>Illmatic</i>. And that&#8217;s a distinction that no small number of people make. Nas&#8217;s predicament reminds me a bit of Bob Dylan&#8217;s. No new album of Dylan&#8217;s will ever be called &#8220;his best ever&#8221;. It would be absurd. The highest praise his new albums can be given is &#8220;the best since <i>Blood on the Tracks</i>&#8220;. High praise, but I imagine that kind of prior success would weigh heavy on an artist. That being said, this is his best album since <i>Illmatic</i>.<br />
<span id="more-102"></span></p>
<p>People often talk of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_age_hip_hop">Golden Age of Hip-Hop</a> from around 1988 to 1993. The golden age is characterized by rapidly-developing new genres, fabulous albums, and social consciousness. In my mind, <i>Illmatic</i> represents the culmination of it. After the golden age, rappers started to fall more and more in love with their money and egos, which led to <a href="http://www.mtv.com/bands/n/nas/news_feature_012102/">ridiculousness</a> like the Tupac/Biggie and Nas/Jay-Z rivalries. In <i>Hip Hop Is Dead</i>, Nas shows everyone how far hip hop culture has fallen since the good old days.</p>
<p>Nas makes it crystal clear how much he loves that culture, and how in tune he is with its history. On &#8220;Carry on Tradition,&#8221; he calls out the younger rappers for not knowing their roots: &#8220;I got an exam, let&#8217;s see if y&#8217;all pass it / Let&#8217;s see who can quote a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Daddy_Kane">Daddy Kane</a> line the fastest&#8221;.</p>
<p>Having just watched <a href="http://www.thefreshestkids.com/"><i>The Freshest Kids</i></a>, I was particularly struck by the line &#8220;Can&#8217;t forget about the old school / Bam, Caz, Mele Mel, Flash / Rock Steady spinning on they backs&#8221; in &#8220;Can&#8217;t Forget about You&#8221; (<a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=5IaTaC1mrOg">video</a>). That track was produced by Will.I.Am, who has a special place in my heart because he <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kimbalina/392436125/">came to the Googleplex</a>. He also produced the title track, which has one of the most ludicrous choruses I&#8217;ve ever heard:</p>
<blockquote><p>
If hip hop should die before I wake<br />
I&#8217;ll put an extended clip inside of my AK<br />
Roll to every station, murder the DJ<br />
Roll to every station, murder the DJ
</p></blockquote>
<p>No bones about it, Nas is passionate about his Hip Hop. Another stand-out track is &#8220;Still Dreaming&#8221;, which is his collaboration with Kanye West. Its mood is more laid back and reserved than the rest of the tracks, but it&#8217;s a welcome break.</p>
<p>Funniest moment on the album: in the few seconds between &#8220;Who Killed It?&#8221; and Jay-Z&#8217;s &#8220;Black Republican&#8221;, you can hear a computer voice saying &#8220;Hip Hop is so fucking d&#8230;&#8221;. And then Jay-Z comes on with a symphony in the background. I can&#8217;t help but think that this is a great jab at Jay-Z. Even though they&#8217;ve &#8220;reconciled their differences,&#8221; Jay must still represent everything dead about Hip Hop to Nas.</p>
<p>In the end, <i>Hip Hop Is Dead</i> is less a condemnation of contemporary Hip Hop and more a celebration of its history. Perhaps it will open people&#8217;s eyes to that rich history.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This isn&#8217;t a list of my favorite albums that came out in 2006. It&#8217;s a list of albums that became favorites of mine in 2006, regardless of when they were released.</p>
<p><img width=150 height=150 src=wp-content/uploads/2006/album10.jpg align=left valign=top /><br />
10. The Mountain Goats, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mountain_Goats">The Sunset Tree</a> (2005)</p>
<p>Learned about it from the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060101014449/www.pitchforkmedia.com/top/2005/index3.shtml">Pitchfork 2005 list</a>, which has been mysteriously excised from Pitchfork&#8217;s site. I love the album cover. It&#8217;s a pretty quiet album. The last two songs are eerie and wonderful.<br />
<br clear=left /></p>
<p><img width=150 height=150 src=wp-content/uploads/2006/album09.jpg align=left /><br />
9. Joy Division, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_%28Joy_Division_album%29">Substance</a> (1988)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve known I <i>should</i> like Joy Division for a very long time, but sometimes it just takes that extra kick to make it happen. In this case it was seeing how excited Nathan got when &#8220;Dead Souls&#8221; randomly played in the background at someone&#8217;s house. Now that song stands out for me, too, and it was the key to finding more and more to like on this album. It&#8217;s a singles collection &#8212; I still haven&#8217;t been able to get into their original albums.</p>
<p><br clear=left /></p>
<p><img width=150 height=150 src=wp-content/uploads/2006/album08.jpg align=left /><br />
8. Jay-Z, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt">Reasonable Doubt</a> (1996)</p>
<p>I decided that Jay-Z was pretty cool in 2005, when Pitchfork put <i>Blueprint</i> as the #2 album of 2000-2004. Then I thought about <i>Blueprint</i> some more, and decided that, on second thought, maybe I didn&#8217;t like Jay-Z after all. So I didn&#8217;t get around to listening to <i>Reasonable Doubt</i> until I saw it on <a href="http://www.mtv.com/bands/h/hip_hop_week/2005/greatest_albums_0505/index6.jhtml">this list</a>. I really love the sound of this album, starting on the very first track (right after the skit). The guest spots are incredible, with Memphis Bleek on &#8220;Coming of Age&#8221; and Foxy sounding tough as nails &#8220;Ain&#8217;t No Nigga&#8221;. And &#8220;22 two&#8217;s&#8221; may just be the cleverest song I&#8217;ve ever heard.</p>
<p><br clear=left /></p>
<p><img width=150 height=150 src=wp-content/uploads/2006/album07.jpg align=left /><br />
7. Michael Jackson, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangerous_%28album%29">Dangerous</a> (1991)</p>
<p>What do Hurricane Katrina and Michael Jackson&#8217;s <i>Dangerous</i> have to do with each other? Not much, but Katrina did drive a mysterious girl from Tulane over to Rice who convinced me that MJ wasn&#8217;t so bad. According to her, this album was &#8220;probably his artistic height,&#8221; so I had great expectations.</p>
<p>Tracks 1-6 are incredibly upbeat, but at 5-6 minutes a pop, the front half of this album gets incredibly tiring. But then we start healing the world and things settle down until the end. I was forced to sing &#8220;Heal the World&#8221; in grade school, so the song has been forever ruined for me. But &#8220;Black or White&#8221; is amazing, and the remaining tracks are solid, easy listening. And then there&#8217;s &#8220;Dangerous&#8221; to close things out.</p>
<p>Michael Jackson may be better when his artistry is less heightened, but <i>Dangerous</i> is a solid album.</p>
<p><br clear=left /></p>
<p><img width=150 height=150 src=wp-content/uploads/2006/album06.jpg align=left /><br />
6. Talking Heads, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_In_The_Vaseline:_Popular_Favorites">Sand in the Vaseline</a> (1992)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been a fan of <i>Remain in Light</i>, but the rest of the Talking Heads songs just didn&#8217;t click for me. Then I heard a story about David Byrne giving a concert in the Eighties while &#8220;coked out of his mind,&#8221; and somehow that did the trick.</p>
<p><i>Sand in the Vaseline</i> is a singles collection and it was great company on my ride across the country, particularly the second disc. Standouts for me were &#8220;Lifetime Piling Up&#8221; and especially &#8220;(Nothing But) Flowers&#8221;.</p>
<p><br clear=left /></p>
<p><img width=150 height=150 src=wp-content/uploads/2006/album05.jpg align=left /><br />
5. Art Brut, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bang_Bang_Rock_and_Roll">Bang Bang Rock and Roll</a> (2005)</p>
<p>A winner from the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060101013417/www.pitchforkmedia.com/top/2005/index5.shtml">2005 list</a>. Who can resist &#8220;Formed a Band&#8221;? I normally prefer more mellow songs, but Art Brut is best when they&#8217;re completely strung out. &#8220;Good Weekend&#8221; and &#8220;Modern Art&#8221; are two of my faves. I went to the San Francisco MOMA a few months ago and suddenly had &#8220;Modern Art! Makes Me! Want to <i>ROCK OUT</i>!&#8221; stuck in my head, and it made me smile ear to ear. Who the hell says that?</p>
<p><br clear=left /></p>
<p><img width=150 height=150 src=wp-content/uploads/2006/album04.jpg align=left /><br />
4. The Velvet Underground, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loaded_%28album%29">Loaded</a> (1971)</p>
<p>I decided to listen to this album after seeing how happy &#8220;Sweet Jane&#8221; made somebody when it came on at a party. Sweet Jane makes me happy, too, as do the rest of the first three tracks on here (&#8220;Who Loves the Sun&#8221; and &#8220;Rock and Roll&#8221;). The rest of the album took a lot longer, but it came around. I still love the start. &#8220;Who loves the sun? Who cares that it makes flowers? Who cares that it makes showers, since you broke my heart?&#8221;</p>
<p><br clear=left /></p>
<p><img width=150 height=150 src=wp-content/uploads/2006/album03.jpg align=left /><br />
3. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clap_Your_Hands_Say_Yeah_%28album%29">Clap Your Hands Say Yeah!</a> (2005)</p>
<p>The big winner of Pitchfork&#8217;s <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060101014449/www.pitchforkmedia.com/top/2005/index4.shtml">2005 list</a> for me. Rarely does an album simultaneously do well on the year-end best list and the year-end <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/10352/Staff_List_2005_Comments_and_Lists_The_15_Worst_Releases_of_20">worst list</a>. I think the opening track is there to make &#8220;Let the Cool Goddess Rust Away&#8221; sound just that much better. Standouts are &#8220;Details of the War&#8221; and &#8220;The Skin of my Yellow Country Teeth&#8221;, but the whole album sounds great. Except for the opener &#8220;Clap Your Hands!&#8221;, of course.</p>
<p><br clear=left /></p>
<p><img width=150 height=150 src=wp-content/uploads/2006/album02.jpg align=left /><br />
2. Belle and Sebastian, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_You%27re_Feeling_Sinister">If You&#8217;re Feeling Sinister</a> (1999)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing that I didn&#8217;t discover this album sooner, given its <a href="http://pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/36737/Staff_List_Top_100_Albums_of_the_1990s/page_9">prominent placement</a> on Pitchfork&#8217;s 90&#8242;s list. I made an MP3 CD of the top 13 albums on that list a few years ago, and at #14 B&amp;S just missed the cutoff. It&#8217;s too bad. I loved this album almost instantly, especially &#8220;Stars of Track and Field&#8221;, &#8220;Get Me Away from Here I&#8217;m Dying&#8221; and &#8220;Judy and the Dream of Horses&#8221;. All three are perfect songs. It takes me back to good times in high school and college, feeling innocent and in love. Did I mention that &#8220;Stars of Track and Field&#8221; is just great? It&#8217;s forever changed my image of high school running with the girl who &#8220;only did it so / that you could wear / you terry underwear / and feel the city air / run past your body&#8221;.</p>
<p><br clear=left /></p>
<p><img width=150 height=150 src=wp-content/uploads/2006/album01.jpg align=left /><br />
1. Nas, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illmatic">Illmatic</a> (1994)<br />
In all fairness, I liked <i>Illmatic</i> before 2006, but this was a really good year for me and Nas. Forget the whole rivalry with Jay-Z, this is just Nas showing what he can do. &#8220;New York State of Mind&#8221; sets the tone for the album. It&#8217;s got a simple, perfect beat. It&#8217;s just a few piano notes over and over, but with Nas&#8217;s words over them, it sounds downright menacing. &#8220;Life&#8217;s a Bitch&#8221; is a perfect track with a <a href="http://blog.rhapsody.com/2006/07/its_been_a_long.html">perfect guest spot</a> by AZ. Almost every track on this album is fantastic, and only &#8220;It Ain&#8217;t Hard to Tell&#8221; feels at all over-produced. The lyrics are incredibly dense but somebody must have told Nas &#8220;enunciate&#8221; before he recorded this, because they&#8217;re not too hard to pick out. Every once in a while you&#8217;ll catch a few lines that just blow you away. The album&#8217;s loaded with gems: &#8220;keep static like wool fabric&#8221;, &#8220;I need a new nigga, for this black cloud to follow / Cause while it&#8217;s over me it&#8217;s too dark to see tomorrow&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;One Love&#8221; is another standout that&#8217;s a letter to his boys in the tank. He lets them know how things are going, and then there&#8217;s lines that hit you like these: &#8220;So stay civilized, time flies / though incarcerated your mind dies / I hate it when your mom cries / it kinda makes me want to murder, for real-a / I&#8217;ve even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs / for one love&#8221;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mostly out of curiosity, I tried to do some race and gender statistics on my iTunes Library this evening. Weighted by number of tracks I&#8217;ve played in the last three months, here&#8217;s how my iTunes library breaks down. By race:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>White</b> 1340 tracks played</li>
<li><b>Black</b> 505 tracks played</li>
</ul>
<p>By gender:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Male</b> 1833 tracks played</li>
<li><b>Female</b> 12 tracks played</li>
</ul>
<p>This is by race/gender of the lead vocalist only. Apparently I&#8217;m sexist but not racist. The numbers don&#8217;t change too much if you count Michael Jackson as white.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t been able to find a good way to automate this. There&#8217;s tons of directories of musicians and bands, but none of them include information about race or gender. The closest I&#8217;ve found is the <a href="http://nndb.com">Notable Names database</a> which has <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/985/000030895/">some musicians</a>, but <a href="http://search.nndb.com/search/nndb.cgi?nndb=1&#038;omenu=unspecified&#038;query=jeff+magnum">nonspectacular coverage</a>.</p>
