				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Don&#8217;t get caught up in all the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLIII">Super Bowl</a> hoopla — the really exciting match this weekend starts five hours from now in Australia.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer">Roger Federer</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal">Rafael Nadal</a> are facing off in yet another Grand Slam final. This time, though, Rafa is the #1 tennis player in the world and Federer is #2.</p>
<p>They both have quite a bit at stake. If Nadal wins, I think it&#8217;s safe to say that he&#8217;s completely emerged from Federer&#8217;s shadow. And given that he won both the French Open and Wimbledon last year, he&#8217;ll be a serious threat to pull of a true Grand Slam (all four majors in the same calendar year).</p>
<p>If Federer wins, he ties <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Sampras">Pete Sampras</a>&#8217;s record for most major titles (14) and cements his claim as the &#8220;greatest of all time&#8221;.</p>
<p>The match starts at 12:30 AM PST (3:30 AM EST) on ESPN. TiVo&#8217;s are recommended!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Because of the 15 hour time difference, most Americans don&#8217;t get particularly excited about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open">Australian Open</a>. It&#8217;s our loss. The first major of the year always manages to produce some interesting stories, and this year is no exception. Good thing there&#8217;s danvk.org to help you catch up!</p>
<p>Yesterday alone saw:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Roddick">Andy Roddick</a> lose to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Kohlschreiber">Philipp Kohlschreiber</a> in a five-setter
<li> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Blake">James Blake</a> come back from two sets down to beat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Grosjean">Sebastian Grosjean</a>
<li> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Gonzalez">Fernando Gonzalez</a>, last year&#8217;s finalist, lost to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marin_Cilic">Marin Cilic</a>, a player I&#8217;ve never heard of.
<li> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer">Roger Federer</a> eek out a 6-7(5), 7-6(1), 5-7, 6-1, 10-8 victory over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janko_Tipsarevic">Janko Tipsarevic</a>
</ul>
<p><img src='http://www.danvk.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/tipsarevic.jpeg' alt='tipsarevic.jpeg' align=right style="padding-left:5px;" /> I managed to catch the last set of the Federer match, and it was fantastic. Both players played well. Federer had less trouble on his serve in the final set (he set a career high for aces in a match), but with each passing game it seemed like the chances of some random twist turning the match the other way increased. After all, the last time Roger lost here was in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Australian_Open_-_Men's_Singles">2005</a>, when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marat_Safin">Marat Safin</a> knocked him out in a five-setter that ended well after midnight.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll be fun to see if Tipsarevic continues to play this well. He seems like an interesting guy. He&#8217;s the only tennis player I know of who wears goggles on court, and he has a Dostoyevsky quote tattooed on him (&#8220;Beauty will save the world&#8221; from <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Idiot">The Idiot</a></i>). Frankly, I&#8217;m surprised that more young players don&#8217;t throw the kitchen sink at Fed like Janko did. It&#8217;s a great way to make a name for yourself. After all, people first started noticing Federer when he knocked off <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Sampras">Pete Sampras</a> at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Wimbledon_Championships">2001 Wimbledon Championships</a>.</p>
<p>The announcers on ESPN pointed out an interesting fact about this tournament. It&#8217;s the first time in many years that a single tournament can decide who will be #1. Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rankings in tennis are based on your performance in events over the last 52 weeks.
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal">Rafael Nadal</a> has <b>5780</b> points
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer">Roger Federer</a> has <b>7180</b> points
<li>At a Grand Slam you get <b>1000</b> points for winning, <b>700</b> for runner-up, <b>450</b> for semis, <b>250</b> for quarters, <b>150</b> for round of 16, <b>75</b> for round of 32, etc.
<li>Roger got 1000 points last year &#8212; if he&#8217;d lost yesterday, he would have dropped to <b>6225</b> points
<li>Nadal got 250 points last year &#8212; if he wins this year, he&#8217;ll have <b>6530</b> points
</ul>
<p>If Roger makes it to the semis, or Rafa doesn&#8217;t win the title, then Federer will remain number one. You can argue about the merits of the tennis ranking system, but it&#8217;s certainly predictable!</p>
<p>One final twist: if Rafa doesn&#8217;t pass Roger at this tournament, it will be impossible for him to do so for several more months. That&#8217;s because Rafa cleaned up during this time last year, while Federer kept losing to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillermo_Cañas">this guy</a>. Rafa has points to defend, while Federer does not. You can see the full points breakdown on the <a href="http://www.atptennis.com/">ATP</a> profiles for <a href="http://www.atptennis.com/3/en/players/playerprofiles/pointsbreakdown.asp?player=F324">Federer</a> and <a href="http://www.atptennis.com/3/en/players/playerprofiles/pointsbreakdown.asp?player=N409">Nadal</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>(See also <a href="/wp/?p=257">podcasts</a> and <a href="/wp/?p=254">TV shows</a>)</i></p>
<p>While podcasts are great for the daily commute, books work pretty well, too. That 2+ hour daily commute translates into a huge number of pages. Most of these are books I read in the latter half of the year.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m too lazy to include images this time, but I included two bonus faves at the end to make up for it.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.michaelpollan.com/omnivore.php">The Omnivore&#8217;s Dilemma</a></b><br />
<i>Michael Pollan</i><br />
This book really opened my eyes to how agriculture and the food industry in the United States work. Pollan follows four &#8220;food chains&#8221; from bottom to top: garden-variety industrial, organic, local and &#8220;hunter-gathered&#8221;, meeting unforgettable characters along the way. I&#8217;ve been reminded many times this year just how much I learned from this book.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=TWvMZpQ6F2cC">Great Expectations</a></b><br />
<i>Charles Dickens</i><br />
It&#8217;s almost impossible to believe that I read this book in High School, given how little (i.e. major plot points) I remembered a second time around. I enjoyed the book much more this time around. This is mostly because I&#8217;ve had more experiences in my life now than I&#8217;d had ten years ago. Having had relationships and having moved from home into the unknown, I found it easy to relate to Pip&#8217;s changing fortunes. Estella is the most memorable character. &#8220;He calls the knaves Jacks, he does!&#8221;</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/King-Leopolds-Ghost-Heroism-Colonial/dp/0618001905">King Leopold&#8217;s Ghost</a></b><br />
<i>Adam Hochschild</i><br />
I&#8217;d heard &#8220;the race for Africa&#8221; referenced before reading this book, but never fully understood why it was such a catastrophe. This is an in-depth look at one aspect of it, the exploitation of the Congo by King Leopold&#8217;s Belgium for ivory and rubber. This was an extremely educational book for me. It&#8217;s a great look into how the world worked in the Guilded Age, as it helped me understand some of Africa&#8217;s problems today. One nit, though: Hochschild is inconsistent in whether he judges people by the norms of their own day versus our own. He finds the racism of many of his heroes understandable for its time, but Leopold is always presented as a modern man scheming to exploit the Congolese.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moveable-Feast-Ernest-Hemingway/dp/068482499X">A Moveable Feast</a></b><br />
<i>Ernest Hemingway</i><br />
I heard about this at a Hemingway-themed party and greatly enjoyed it. Though it was published after his death, it recounts Hemingway&#8217;s time in Paris in the 1920&#8242;s. He has great stories to tell about all the famous writers and groups of the time, and his style works perfectly for this short read.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Autobiography-Malcolm-X-Told-Haley/dp/0345350685">The Autobiography of Malcolm X</a></b><br />
<i>Malcolm X, Alex Haley</i><br />
Malcolm X lived one of the seminal lives of the 20th century: his father was murdered by the KKK (it was ruled a suicide), he led a colorful life of crime during the Harlem Renaissance, became an influential leader of the Nation of Islam and was assassinated. If you&#8217;re not up for reading the book, the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104797/">Spike Lee movie</a>is fantastic.</p>
<p>OK, now the bonuses! Here are two articles I&#8217;ve enjoyed this year that you can read online:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regardless of whether you enjoy watching tennis, you&#8217;ll enjoy this New York Times piece by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace">David Foster Wallace</a>:<br />
&ldquo;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/sports/playmagazine/20federer.html">Roger Federer as Religious Experience</a>&rdquo;.</li>
<li>If you have a commute, you&#8217;ll really enjoy this article from the New Yorker: &ldquo;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/04/16/070416fa_fact_paumgarten">There and Back Again</a>&rdquo; by Nick Paumgarten
</ul>

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_U.S._Open_(tennis)">2007 US Open</a> is winding its way to the final weekend. There have been some surprises, like defending champ Maria Sharapova&#8217;s early exit, and some fun matches, like James Blake&#8217;s loss to Tommy Haas in a fifth-set tiebreak.</p>
<p>Last night&#8217;s match between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Roddick">Andy Roddick</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer">Roger Federer</a> was the most hyped of the tournament. The result was no surprise. Federer won in straights. The messaging on this match has been spectacularly consistent: Roddick played brilliantly, but there&#8217;s no shame in losing to the greatest player of all time. I think this is crap. People need to stop going so easy on Roddick. He&#8217;s <a href="http://www.atptennis.com/3/en/players/headtohead/?player1=Federer%2C+Roger&#038;player2=Andy+Roddick">1-14</a> against Roger all-time and 0-9 since 2004. He hasn&#8217;t taken a <i>set</i> off the guy this year. Maybe if people stopped patting him on the back after every loss and telling him how close he came, then he&#8217;d be forced to regroup and find a way to deliver.</p>
<p>One highlight of the match was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi">Andre Agassi</a>&#8217;s debut as an announcer. Great players often make great announcers, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McEnroe">John McEnroe</a> is <a href="http://tennisworld.typepad.com/thewrap/2007/07/wimbledon-repor.html">the best in the business</a>. Andre didn&#8217;t pipe up too frequently, but everything he said was interesting. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/usopen07/news/story?id=3006194">one exchange</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
When Roddick stared down Federer and bellowed after a 138 mph ace to get to 4-4 in the first set, Agassi said: &#8220;There&#8217;s a fine line between getting pumped up and waking a sleeping giant, I assure you.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Another great moment came when Andre revealed how he used to deal with Boris Becker&#8217;s. He picked up on a tell &#8212; whenever Boris stuck his tongue out before a serve, he was sure to go down the middle. What an edge that would give you! I wonder if Roger&#8217;s picked up on anything like that. Andy&#8217;s serve just doesn&#8217;t seem to phase him.</p>
<p>My picks &#8212; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justine_Henin">Justine Henin</a> beats <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svetlana_Kuznetsova">Svetlana Kuznetsova</a> in the Women&#8217;s final Saturday. On the men&#8217;s side, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic">Novak Djokovic</a> beats <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ferrer">David Ferrer</a> in the semis before losing a close final to the man himself, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer">Roger Federer</a>.</p>

It sets up an interesting final with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer">Roger Federer</a> tomorrow afternoon (noon PST) in Montreal. Fed&#8217;s never lost to Djokovic before, (he&#8217;s <a href="http://www.atptennis.com/3/en/players/headtohead/?player1=Djokovic%2C+Novak&#038;player2=Federer">4-0</a>) but they haven&#8217;t played since Djokovic cracked the top ten earlier this year. This is the final I was <a href="http://www.danvk.org/wp/?p=184">rooting for</a> at Wimbledon earlier this year, as those elusive &#8220;astute readers of danvk.org&#8221; will recall. I&#8217;m calling Fed two sets. I don&#8217;t think Djokovic can beat him.</p>
<p>This week and next also mark one of the more brain-dead stretches of the ATP tour. The top players are required to enter all nine <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Series">Masters Series</a> events, which are just one notch below the Grand Slams. Tomorrow is the Rogers Masters final, and on Monday the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Masters">Cincinnati Masters</a> begins. There&#8217;s not even a one day break, but the players are all required to enter both. This makes for some really exhausted players and surprising results at the Cincy Masters. Last year Federer won the Rogers Masters, but lost to #21 Andy Murray in early round play the next week. For a sense of what an aberration this was, Fed only lost to two players last year: Nadal and Andy Murray. It&#8217;s absurd that the ATP continues to schedule the Masters Series in this way.</p>
<p><b>Update</b>: Novak made me eat my words, winning 7-6(2), 2-6, 7-6(2). Fed came quite close to winning the first set: he botched five set points before Djokovic sent it to the &#8216;breaker. Mad props to him, I underestimated him. He&#8217;ll be fun to watch at the US Open this fall.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I took some grief for writing too much about the French Open, so I&#8217;ve avoided saying anything about the last two weeks at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Wimbledon_Championships">Wimbledon</a>. I get one post though, right?</p>
<p>The main story has been rain. It&#8217;s been so wet that Nadal wound up needing five days to finish his third-round match against Robin Soderling. The tournament got way behind schedule, so many players have been playing on back to back to back days. Men&#8217;s quarters were today, men&#8217;s semis are tomorrow, and the finals are the next day.</p>
<p>That makes for some really tired players, so we&#8217;ve been getting a few surprise results. A lot of matches have been one-sided at the beginning, then a player gets tired or hurt, and the match suddenly reverses. That&#8217;s what happened to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Roddick">Andy Roddick</a> today. He was up two sets and a break on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gasquet">Richard Gasquet</a>, but wound up losing a 6-4, 6-4, 7-6, 7-6, 8-6 marathon. NBC must be all kinds of pissed. Instead of getting a marquee matchup with an American, Andy Roddick vs. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer">Roger Federer</a>, they get a lopsided matchup with a player nobody&#8217;s heard of. Remember the tight schedules? After playing a four hour slugfest than finished after 8 PM, Gasquet has to wake up tomorrow morning and play Roger Federer at noon. It&#8217;s going to be a blowout.</p>
<p>The women&#8217;s final is also going to be a blowout. Venus Williams has been playing out of her mind, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Bartoli">Marion Bartoli</a> (who upset <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justine_Henin">Justine Henin</a> today) has never played in a Grand Slam final before. There&#8217;s a fine tradition of choking in your Grand Slam final debut on the women&#8217;s tour. See Anna Ivanovic and Justine herself for reference. Expect more of that tomorrow.</p>
<p>The one interesting match is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal">Nadal</a> vs. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic">Djokovic</a> semi. These guys will both be exhausted. They&#8217;ve both played several days in a row and had a few five-setters. I&#8217;m picking Nadal in five, but I&#8217;ll be rooting for Djokovic.</p>
<p>Another random note: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Collins">Bud Collins</a>, the veteran NBC tennis commentator, is retiring. Good riddance. This guy is like the Dick Vitale of tennis. Nobody likes him. His role now is mostly to do cringe-inducing post-match interviews with the champions. A sampler: Bud: &#8220;On clay, Rafa is el Rey!&#8221; Nadal: &#8220;hehehe, ahhmm&#8221; (awkwardly looks for anyone else to talk to). Way to go, Bud.</p>
<p><b>Update</b>: An update doesn&#8217;t break my one-post limit, does it? I called all three matches correctly. Venus and Fed rolled, and Nadal won. I called five sets, but it only went three. Djokovic hurt his foot and had to retire in the third set, tied at one set apiece, presumably on its way to a thrilling fifth. =) I&#8217;m picking Fed in four tomorrow. The final is on NBC at 9 AM EST/6 AM PST.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nadal played well in the French Open final, but Roger mostly beat himself. The key statistic: Federer won on only one out of 16 break point chances. Ten of those were in the first set, which he really should have won. Roger must be all kinds of pissed. He refused post-match interviews.</p>
<p>With three convincing losses to Rafa in the last three French Opens, you&#8217;ve got to wonder whether Roger can ever pull it off.</p>
<p>In other, unrelated sports news, congrats to the Rice Owls on making the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_College_World_Series">College World Series</a> again. I regret not going to Omaha to cheer them a year ago. Hopefully they can do it this time!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four rounds into the <a href="http://www.rolandgarros.com/en_FR/">French Open</a>, we&#8217;re still on track for my <a href="http://www.danvk.org/wp/?p=155">dream final</a> of Federer vs. Nadal. Nobody&#8217;s played spoiler to either yet. In fact, nobody&#8217;s even taken a set off either of them. That gives Fed a pretty impressive streak: he&#8217;s won 35 straight sets at Grand Slams. The statisticians went scurrying, but I believe this really is a genuine record.</p>
<p>The big match for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_French_Open_-_Women%27s_Singles">the women</a> tomorrow is Serena Williams vs. Justine Henin. Henin&#8217;s won two French Opens in a row, but Serena won the Australian this year and is on a hot streak. I&#8217;m rooting for Serena. She&#8217;s the last American left (all nine American men lost in the opening round) and, quite frankly, Justine is a jerk. They had an incident at the 2003 French Open that was rather revealing. Henin raised her hand to stop the point while Serena was in her service motion. She served it into the net as a courtesy, but the chair ump hadn&#8217;t seen the hand. He called it a fault. Serena argued, and Justine refused to step in and say she&#8217;d raised her hand. The winner of this match will be the favorite to win the title.</p>
<p>There are some really fun looking matches on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_French_Open_-_Men%27s_Singles">the men&#8217;s side</a> as well. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillermo_Ca%C3%B1as">Guillermo Cañas</a> is back from a doping suspension and has been on a tear. He beat Federer twice earlier this year, and they&#8217;re on track for a semifinal matchup. That would be a spectacularly interesting match. I&#8217;d still pick Federer, but unlike so many other players, Canas will have confidence that he can beat Fed. Nadal&#8217;s half of the draw should be easier, though <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic">Novak Đoković</a> has been playing very well.</p>
<p><b>Update</b>: Three out of four ain&#8217;t bad. I got Fed, Nadal and Djokovic, but missed Davydenko, who beat Canas in straight sets. I&#8217;ll be very surprised if I don&#8217;t get my final.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://www.danvk.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/ten_a_federer_195.jpg' alt='ten_a_federer_195.jpg' align=right style="padding:5px" />Apparently there&#8217;s a big gaping hole in my RSS subscriptions. Roger Federer <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=2876658&#038;campaign=rss&#038;source=TENNISHeadlines">beats Rafael Nadal</a> on <i>clay</i> and it takes me three whole days to notice?</p>
<p>This is kind of a big deal. Nadal hadn&#8217;t lost on clay in over two years, the past 81 matches. Federer was 0-5 against Nadal on clay before this match. And that&#8217;s a record that mattered, since the biggest clay-court tournament, the French Open, is coming up in four days. If Federer can win the French, he&#8217;ll have pulled off tennis&#8217;s greatest feat, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_%28tennis%29">Grand Slam</a>, something no man has done since Rod Laver in 1969.</p>
<p>The French is definitely the most exciting Grand Slam tournament these days, since it&#8217;s the only one that Fed isn&#8217;t expected to win in a rout. I woke up at 5 AM to watch the final last year, and it was phenomenal. Nadal was up two sets to one and a break, and it seemed as though it might just end there. But Fed kicked it up a notch, won some absurd points to force a tie-break, and for a moment, it looked like he just might pull it off. But all to no avail. Nadal took him out 7-4 in the tiebreak.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got to give Nadal some serious credit. He&#8217;s the only reason that Federer hasn&#8217;t won eight slams in a row, and 12 of the last 13. That&#8217;s some kind of pressure, but he&#8217;s never withered under it in the past. Mark your calendar, the French Open starts on Sunday, and the men&#8217;s final is on Sunday, June 10. I&#8217;ll be tremendously disappointed if it&#8217;s not a rematch of last year&#8217;s.</p>
