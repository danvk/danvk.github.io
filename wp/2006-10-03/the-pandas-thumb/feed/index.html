		<description><![CDATA[I do research in evolutionary biology, and I love Gould, so Dawkins really rankles me when he makes comments like that.

Gould and Dawkins were often on opposite sides of big debates in evolutionary biology (not the least of which is sociobiology), and in general, Gould often had a clearer idea of the issues, and a more nuanced approach to them. Which is a long-winded way of saying &quot;he was usually right&quot;.

One of the most frustrating things about reading anything by Dawkins on these debates is that he consistently fails to see what Gould is saying. The tenacious arrogance that serves him so well against religious zealots makes him into a bit of a stubborn fool when it comes to actual science.]]></description>
