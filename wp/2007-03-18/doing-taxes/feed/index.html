		<description><![CDATA[Danvk... I can assure you that writing code for TurboTax is an immense effort and does require a lot of exceptional programming (including If xxx, then yyy, except for zzz...). All you have to do is look at the IRS Code someday (what a joy!) to understand it&#039;s spagetti code with exception after exception. Anyway, you must be doing a great job at Google because I use all their tools/services and think they are awesome. Also sounds like one of the best places to work.
