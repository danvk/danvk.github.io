		<description><![CDATA[Hello,

I&#039;m having the same problems that Tom and Wolf are having; it looks as though iTunes 8 has broken the script in places. Track Parser is sooooo useful....I&#039;d be eternally grateful if you could update the script sometime!

Many thanks for a wonderful tool,

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I&#039;ve checked and rechecked, but since iTunes v8.x Track Parser is not working anymore. The entry at Dougs AppleScripts hasn&#039;t been updated since 01/2005 so I came here again to see if there&#039;s any news about an upgrade or a workaround / fix.
I wasn&#039;t really expecting something, since I myself would probably not be updating a script this old. But then, this things is indispensable for me - and maybe for somebody else too.
Any way you could be persuaded to have a look at it? AppleScript is still AS. iTunes has maybe modified some parameter or what that has the script falling over. Maybe even easy to fix. And it would make me happy. Very much so. :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Track Parser is wonderful!

I&#039;m wondering if the substitute (album) pattern quit working because of recent iTunes changes?  Maybe &quot;album&quot; is name somehting internally now?

I&#039;m trying to parse the Disc number from the album track (for an 18 CD set, but I get the following error:

Can&#039;t get every item of &quot;l&quot;.

I saw note of an open source Track Parser, but can&#039;t find it to see if the &quot;l&quot; needs to refer to a new element in recent iTunes...

--

Yes this is (still) very useful software.

		<description><![CDATA[First, I echo the thanks for such a cool script.  Last night I tried to send you an email at Rice and it bounced.  I was trying to send the email b/c I was having problems and I was trying to figure out if it was possible to use track parser to do something specific.

In the first case, today I figured out the problem, and have discovered what may be a bug in the script.  I can describe the whole thing in detail if you contact me.

In the second case, track parser mostly focuses on taking hunks of information that have been glommed together into track names and parsing up and out to their proper fields.  In my case, I actually want to add some of those fields back *in* to the track name; is that possible?  Specifically, I want to add the &quot;album name&quot; at the beginning of the track name, separate by a comma.  This is because what I am actually working with are chapters from an audio book, and the way that the iPod presents audiobooks is slightly different from the way it presents music.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I too have gotten great use from Track Parser. I originally downloaded it from Doug&#039;s Applescripts for iTunes. It is hands down the most powerful tag manager out there. I&#039;d probably get even more use out of it if I&#039;d just take some time to learn regex.

I do have a question about the &quot;Parser (Clipboard)&quot; script. Is there a way to remove a saved pattern from the main menu?

Thanks,
Jose]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While google&#039;ing your name for a home page and maybe updated version of track parser I came across your site, and got stuck at your blog. After reading a couple of nice entrys this one popped up, reminding me about why I was here... ;-)

Thanks for sharing Track Parser with us. In the last two years it silently replaced almost all other plugins I used to straighten out track information. 
And thanks for giving it out as source code; by looking at it&#039;s innards I even learned something about AppleScript, which still eludes me most of the time, though.

Thanks. Thanks very much!

Cheers from Germany.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i emailed you a while back about track parser.. just want to say thanks again for it, i use it pretty much every time i&#039;m in itunes lately. actually i&#039;ve whittled down your version a bit, i don&#039;t really use the saved expressions so now i can call it up w/ a shortcut, enter my regex, and i&#039;m done. but i&#039;d be lost w/o the core of the script you&#039;ve put together.

cheers,
