		<description><![CDATA[Hello,

I&#039;ve used your algorithm for converting hexadecimal and decimal numbers of arbitrary position, and extended it to work for binary and octal bases aswell as part of my conversion project (see noseglid/canumb at github).

I just wanted to contribute a small bit, if you initialize &#039;outArray&#039; in your &#039;convertBase&#039; function to &#039;[ 0 ]&#039;, rather than an empty array &#039;[]&#039;, it will work for the special input 0 aswell. As of now that returns undefined.

Take care.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[About Track Parser:

Dan, where are the custom scripts PHYSICALLY located?

I&#039;ve got dozens of scripts (love your script, BTW, it&#039;s indispensable to me, which is part of the urgency) and I have been on Snow Leopard and iTunes 10 until now.  I am required to upgrade to Mavericks (and iTunes 11) by tomorrow so I can use this stupid new software that only runs on Mavericks.

It&#039;s not in iTunes, and I looked in /Library/Application Support, but without some kind of name, I can&#039;t even Spotlight them so they can be copied to the new disk.

If there&#039;s no resolution, I plan to keep the Snow Leopard drive in its own case and boot to it for personal stuff.  I&#039;d much rather just figure this out.  :-)

I&#039;d appreciate your help.  Really just need to know where the &quot;01 - Beatles - Taxman&quot; stuff is so I can migrate it to the new disk.

Thanks in advance.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for Old SF - great stuff. Have been waiting for someone to geo-ref all those photos (really!)

One correction though - you have many photos of SF State Teachers college located at the current SF State campus. The current campus is only since 1953. The original location was downtown at Waller and Buchannan.]]></description>
