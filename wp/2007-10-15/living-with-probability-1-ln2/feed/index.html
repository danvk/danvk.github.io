		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t buy it, Dan.  I haven&#039;t looked at the solution yet, because I want to give it some more thought and see if I can change my mind, but I&#039;ll share with you my initial thoughts that make me feel like there&#039;s no way to get 30%. 

Change the objective so that instead of having to get all 100 right, you only need the first 2 to get it right.  This is more likely (given that in order to get all 100 right, the first 2 also have to get theirs right).  Assume wlog that person 1 picks boxes 1 - 50.  Person 2 can assume person 1 got his right, since otherwise they have lost already..  The best he can do is pick the other boxes 51 -100 (since he can assume one of the 1st 50 contained the other guy&#039;s name: not his own).  But this only gives him a 50/99 chance of getting his name!  

Soooo, it seems to me the best you can do even for the first 2 people both being correct is only 25.25%!  

I&#039;ll see if I can find the error of my ways, but I ain&#039;t seeing it.]]></description>
