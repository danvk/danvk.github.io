		<description><![CDATA[Hello danvk,

  This is Proto from India. That was a pretty good review of the Reader, a tool I love using. Hope you would have read this excellent review by Gina Trapani of Lifehacker:

  I would like to point out one thing about the GMail macros script. There is a stupid way by which you can retain your favorite &quot;g i&quot; combination. Refrain from naming labels starting with &quot;I&quot;. I know it sounds stupid (but I have been religiously doing that for an year or more now), but it does give you satisfaction that you can have the cake and eat it too. Believe me, if you are not using GMail macros, you are really missing something quite useful and beautiful :).

Regards,
Proto
