Although pretending that it didn&#039;t exist was almost a viable strategy for those of us whose &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;countries &lt;/a&gt; failed to qualify. That or pretending to be Irish.

Mind you, you&#039;re welcome to the Beckham circus. Beckham is a very good player, fairly talented, but wouldn&#039;t bother the very top echelon of players, the likes of Moore, Beckenbauer, Zidane, Pele. Maradona (etc and so on - Beckham would IMHO be very lucky to make the top 20). He is very hard working though. It&#039;s the anorexic fame-whore he&#039;s married to that&#039;s the problem.]]></description>
