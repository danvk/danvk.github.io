		<description><![CDATA[Hmmm:

I&#039;ve been to 2 in group 1,

7 in group 2 (all the ones you have been to minus thep phenom)

13 in group 3 (granted, group 3 has some of the closest ones to me)

O&#039;Looney&#039;s isn&#039;t as much of a restaurant as a liquor store. 

And if you start venturing out just a bit more you&#039;ll have to take into account everything on haight to divis, all the restaurants on divis, all the restaurants on church st., 14th st. a couple on sanchez, duboce, aghh there&#039;s so many. 

At one point I decided I was going to try atleast one new restaurant every week but I haven&#039;t done that quite yet..]]></description>
