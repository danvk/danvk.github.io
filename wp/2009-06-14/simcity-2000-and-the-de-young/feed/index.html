		<description><![CDATA[Hi, sorry to post this here but i couldn&#039;t find an email address to reach you at.  

It seems like your track parser, which is extremely useful and awesome, no longer works with iTunes 8 - are you working on a fix or do you have any suggestions?  When parsing info from the album I get &quot;can&#039;t get every item of &quot;l&quot;&quot;, and others seem to be having a similar issue.

Thanks for the wonderful script, I get a ton of use out of it and I speak on behalf of many who would find an update wonderful!

Best,
