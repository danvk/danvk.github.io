- (derat) Write an lmnowave robot
  Automatically linkify clue references in the wave.
  Notify when puzzle is complete
  Fill in answers when someone says "I give up"?

- (danvk) An "Add Crossword" button
  Will need to write a .puz parser in JS.
  http://joshisanerd.com/puz/

- (derat) Figure out a way to source from HEAD via an http request (ala cgit)
  (github URLs include a commit hash)
  Probably use cgit on evan's machine, add an apache rewrite rule.
  Would be nice to have a "danvk" branch for me to test on w/o affecting HEAD.
  (it may already be possible to do this with github)


- Switch to a standard library for event-handling code
  There's lots of weirdness re: onkeypress vs. onkeydown, arrow keys, Safari, etc.
  This code from closure is what we should be using:
  http://doctype.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/goog/events/keyhandler.js
  Or: get Julie or Ojan to fix this =)

- (danvk) Replace the lmnopuz console
  Should be able to use the firebug console in both FF and Chrome.

- Add back keyboard shortcuts like "?". (if possible)

- (danvk) Delete all roster-related code.

- Assign colors to people.
- Store which user filled in a square in the wave state.
- Show other players' cursors (store in wave state).

- A way to check errors/reveal answers

- End game
  Announce when the puzzle is complete.
  Make it immutable when completed correctly.
  Show colors at the end.

- Double-click doesn't change orientation back in Chrome.

- Type a number to go to that clue.

- Some way to automatically get a new wave w/ a new puzzle each day.

- Deal w/ incorrect answer stealing
  imagine A has typed in CORRECT and B comes over and types in MYGUESS; then
  once they realize that CORRECT was correct, B will get credit for all of
  that except the E.  (maybe we could track for each cell who was the first
  to get it right?)
