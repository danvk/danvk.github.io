- Quit my job March 1st, 2023. I'd been thinking about this for at least five years but there was always a reason to stick around a bit longer, until finally there wasn't.
- Initial excitement of freedom! I'm going to do everything I've been putting off. Examples of this were clearing out my inbox and trying to consolidate two HSAs (I failed).
- There are lots of things you'd "like to do more of" but don't have the time to because of work. Previously I'd never encountered the limit of my desire to hike, climb or go on bird walks. But it turns out those limits do exist!
- Sometimes a job is an excuse for not doing things. It turns out that having a job wasn't really the reason I haven't taken Spanish classes, had a regular exercise routine or enthusiastically done house repair work.
- There's an expectation that, as a working age adult, you will have a job. I found it easier to tell people I was working on my book and doing consulting work than to say I was "semi-retired". "Working part-time" is more socially acceptable.
- There are some annoying things about being unemployed in the US. Our health insurance is expensive and not as good as what we had before.
- There's no substitute to working with other people for learning about new tools and technologies. Even my brief time working on RefStudio was instructive here, e.g. learning about poetry.
- Working two days/week on a project is easier than working one day/week.
- I underestimated the extent to which my job structured my weekday schedule.
- I underestimated the value of talking with other tech people every day.
- I've been happy when I have projects, e.g. filling out my Catskills blog or working on Computing in the Catskills.
- We've had less vacation / travel flexibility than I'd expected.
- I'm happy that I've been able to do RC, something I never would have had the time for with a full-time job.
- Overall this has been working out really well.


- Relationship with money would be different if I got a full-time job again. Spending not saving.
- I was much better about journaling early after quitting my job.
- Moving my desk to create a "psychological break" was a good idea.

> It's become increasingly clear to me since coming back to work last December that the Sidewalk I feel sad about leaving no longer exists, and likely hasn't for years. There have been many deaths of Sidewalk: the pandemic, ending the Toronto project, layoffs (round 1), the collapse of Skyline and joining Google. There have been some successes that came out of SWL (CityBlock Health and ReplicaHQ are spinouts that are still going strong) but sadly few. I feel good about wrapping up this era and figuring out what's next.

> With quitting my job, I definitely have images of Wil e Coyote running off the cliff and not realizing that the ground has vanished from underneath him. But I really think we're OK!

> I'm almost two months into my "retirement". What have I been doing to fill my time? Lots of hiking and writing about hiking. I've done seven Catskills hikes since March 1st and, as of yesterday, I've completely filled out my new hiking blog. This was a fun project for me. I went back and catalogued all my old hikes (I found them based on photo locations) and tried to reconstruct GPS tracks with accurate times where I didn't have them (also based on photos). That turned out to be a fun technical challenge. Then I wrote up short posts with photos.

> Finding motivation for things has been more of a challenge than I'd expected during my "retirement". As it turns out, my job wasn't the only thing keeping me from practicing my Spanish, writing on my Effective TypeScript blog or working on open source projects. The solution I see is having a more regular, predictable schedule that makes time for these things. And, of course, finding what I'm genuinely excited about! Catskills hiking and my new Catskills blog have been the main things I've focused on the past two months.

>  I've found it surprisingly hard to get in a regular exercise routine since leaving my job. I have aspirations to exercise in the morning, but I rarely want to do this.

> working one day a week is actually pretty hard because you spend so much of that day catching up on what’s happened. If you want to build something, two days or half time works better. Poetry is a tool I’m happy to have learned about, and I’d like to learn more about TailwindCSS, too.
