Technologies that "change the world" often feel like non-events. Examples:

- Video conferencing. This was the "technology of the future" for 80+ years, since it's so easy to imagine once you have telephones. In the last five years, it's become a reality. And it's nice! But it's also not that big a deal.

- Cell-phones with maps and GPS have made it more or less impossible to get lost. This has been a major problem (and fear!) for all of history. We've eliminated it in the past five years. And it's great! But it's also not something that people talk about much. Maps on cell phones are such an obviously great thing that we've become accustomed to them rapidly.

On the other hand, I imagine that innovations like vaccines or antibiotics _felt_ more amazing at the time.

I wonder about this in the context of self-driving cars. Will they bring about major changes but just be a "nice" thing? Or will they feel revolutionary?
